Would be perfect except for the screen,"To introduce myself, I had a Samsung Skyrocket S2 that decided to die on me at the end of last month, and then my backup phone (a cheap Chinese phone) decided to start dying too. There's a phone I want to spend some money on coming out in the next few months, but I need something to get by and to act as a backup phone when I do make that purchase, so after some searching I settled for this one. I listen to a lot of music on my phone, read email, do some app development of my own as a grad student, and occasionally watch videos on Youtube or use GPS to find some place I've never visited before. All in all, barring development I'm a fairly gentle phone user but I also have some tech savvy to form a useful opinion. When I looked up info on the Advance 4.0, I was able to find specs but not much in the way of useful reviews, so I tried to be as thorough writing this as possible. Design: The Advance 4.0 is bulky for a 4"" phone - it's nearly as large in length and width as my 4.5"" Samsung S2 Skyrocket, and it's thicker too. The outside of the case is smooth plastic - it isn't slippery in the hand but it does attract fingerprints more than any other phone I've had. However, the phone does come with an Otterbox-like case and a screen protector, and I'd recommend using both. Inside under the battery are two SIM slots and an SD slot. The SIM slots are easy to use and well-labelled but the SD slot frankly scares me. It's flimsy and easy to bend and doesn't offer much protection to the card in the slot. Add that to being under the battery and this isn't a phone for someone who likes to use multiple SD cards. However, all of this is to be expected with a phone in this price range, and getting a case and screen protector included is a great deal. Performance: The MediaTek chip and 512mb of RAM in this phone might not be impressive compared to a flagship phone, but for day to day operation they perform admirably. Multitasking is generally quick, Youtube and Google Maps load quickly and the phone is loaded with what is basically stock Jelly Bean, which is great. There's no extra junkware to get rid of and the Play Store is ready to go. I should note that I am not a phone gamer, but if you want a cell phone that can play high-end games this is probably not the phone for you. Social games and the like should work fine (I only tried Angry Birds, hardly a tech demo game). Connectivity: The Advance 4.0's antenna is quite strong - I had trouble getting signal in my basement with my S2, but get 3 bars with this phone. Bluetooth connectivity is similarly impressive - I was able to pair my headset immediately and had signal with my phone in one corner of the house all the way to the garage on the other side - 45 feet away through walls. Data connectivity is flawless - both on wifi and 3g (the phone is compatible with HSPA+) are capped by my provider and ping was good per Speedtest. 3g tethering also works well - assuming your provider lets you do this. Battery: The Advance 4.0 comes with a 1600mah battery, which with the MediaTek chip should last a very long time. To test, I unplugged the phone at 7AM yesterday, and for the entire day streamed music via wifi to my bluetooth headset - a double drain on the battery. I also downloaded a variety of apps and podcasts and browsed the web some. Then I left the phone on overnight, continuing to download more podcasts while I slept. When I plugged it in at 7:30 this morning it still had 25% battery left. For a budget phone this is outstanding. I wouldn't normally listen to 12 hours of music like that, so there's no way I'm going to kill the battery unless I forget to charge it for two days. Screen: ... and this is where the wheels come off. The screen on this phone is just short of abysmal. It's not that it's an 800x480 screen - I've had that resolution on other phones and they looked much better than this one. The colors are distorted unless you are looking directly at the phone. This isn't the usual complaint that reviewers have about viewing angles - you literally can't be tilting the phone at all or it's no good. In addition, even if you are looking directly at it images and videos are grainy and just don't look right. However, for normal phone navigation and app use it's adequate. If you wanted to watch anything on your phone, you will be disappointed. I'm lucky that my top use for a smartphone (streaming music) doesn't require much use of this screen. Conclusion: With a phone in this price range, something always has to give. You either get an a phone that's still running Gingerbread, specs that are subpar, or a battery that can't make it through the day. In this case it's the screen, but even that is really only so bad if you want to watch videos. I expect later this year there will be a lot of competition for budget phones, but if you need a phone right now and only have $100 to spare this is not at all a bad choice.",5,1,,
Hard to complain at that price...,"I bought this phone to upgrade from my AT&T GoPhone Avail (ZTE-Z990). I didn't actually have much of a problem with the Z990, except for one thing: it only had 130MB usable space for installing apps. Even 4 years ago (when I originally bought it) that was considered a minuscule amount of space. After doing everything I could to get around this problem, I finally gave up and decided to find a new phone. The BLU Advance 4.0 has 1.27GB of space for apps (the other 2.72GB is for the Android OS). I know that's still pretty small by today's cell phone standards but it's a HUGE upgrade to me. I can't tell you how wonderful it is to be able to download and install all the apps I want, plus some I never had the option of installing before. (I still use AppMgr Pro III. It lets me know what programs I can move to my external SD card. Out of the 26 apps I've installed, 11 were able to be moved to my SD card. At 37 apps I've only filled half the 1.27GB with the help of AppMgr.) I switched to T-mobile (from AT&T) with this phone. I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't have to touch any settings to get this phone to work with T-mobile. Call, text, and data all loaded automatically when I installed the SIM card. I'm told HSPA+ is 4G. If that's the case then this phone DOES get 4G (as well as 3G and 2G). Reception for cell and data are, of course, entirely dictated by location. I've been very fortunate thus far, all things considered (I live in Wyoming, lol). I was pleasantly surprised to see there was absolutely no ""bloatware"" on this phone. I LOVE IT. There's something immensely satisfying knowing that not one bit of memory is being wasted on an app I don't want. Other than standard Google stuff (which is part and parcel with Android), you only get the basics. Everything else you can customize and tweak to your hearts content. Fantastic! The screen is bright and crisp and it's 4"" (the ""sweet spot"" for phone screens as far as I'm concerned). The up and down viewing angle is horrid though. Just a slight tilt and the colors are completely washed out. (Right and left are fine though.) And, of course, direct sunlight makes the screen unviewable. (My Z990 did the same thing, so I'm use to that.) Straight on view, though, and the screen is lovely. Sadly, the only upgrade I got with the camera on this phone was having a flash. Otherwise it's the exact same as the Z990, if not a little worse. (The auto-focus/focus is middling at best on this phone. It doesn't seem to focus at all with things up-close.) The touch screen is fine. It's no better or worse than other touch screens I've used. That is to say, using a keyboard can be a pain. Swiftkey is how I get around this and I recommend others either get Swiftkey or an app similar to it. (I've heard people have problems with the stock dialer too, their cheek accidently hitting the end-call button. I recommend getting an alternative dialer if that's an issue for you. ExDialer is pretty good.) Speakers are loud enough. If you're in a crowded or noisy place you'll have difficulty (headphones or bluetooth headset might be in order). Minor complaint here: They have one of the worst speakerphone placements I've ever seen.They have the speaker in the lower back (!!) area of the phone... you know... the part of the phone you cover with your hand to hold it? So if you want to listen to music or have hand-free talking, you'll have to hold the phone from the top (!!!!!) or put it screen-side down. I have adapted but it's a very strange and inconvenient design decision on BLU's part. Battery life is OK. It really depends on what you're doing with the phone and how many apps are running in the background. I've not had it die on me yet, but I do make it a point to charge it at night and I have a charger in my car just in case. Also, if you're curious, battery replacements are available. Go to BLU's Amazon Store Front and check their Accessory page to find it. I got a screen protector, protective silicone case, and a earbuds with this phone (along with the standard charger and manual). I tried to use the screen protector but I didn't clean the phone well enough and ended up ruining it. Oh well. The phone itself has a slippery plastic feel to it, so the silicone case is useful as it gives the phone ""grip"". I haven't tested the earbuds but they seem sturdy and of good quality. Speaking of the outside of the phone... it's lovely looking. Someone mentioned it looked cheap in the reviews. I guess that depends on where you're coming from. Having used a Z990 for the last 4 years, the Advance 4 is practically a work of art by comparison. The back is particularly cool looking. (I wish the silicone case was the same color as the phone, or see-through, because it's a shame to have it all covered up.) At $82 this is a perfect phone. There are no ""deal breaking"" issues for me. All the minor annoyances I can either get around or live with. If this phone also proves to be durable (I haven't had it long), I'll be a BLU customer for life. :)",5,1,,
Perfect,"I'm really happy with this phone. It's priced just right and I have all the features I need plus more. I can call, text, take pictures, play games, browse the internet, get directions, download apps and so on. I can even change the background of my text conversations to a personal picture, live wallpaper, or regular wallpaper. I'm currently using an HTC Thunderbolt silicone case for my Blu phone and it fits plus looks nice (I did not receive a case with my phone). The case cut outs don't match but the calls are not affected and the camera cut out will take a slight adjustment and I just slip the case off when I'm charging my phone. I will never go back to a contract with any phone company, ever. UPDATE 3/27/14 Although I still think this phone is nice for the price, there are some things I have noticed while using it more often. The phone has slow reaction at times. My ""demands"" are not always met with speed when texting or playing Bingo Bash, for example. Also, I cannot receive pictures directly in my text messages. I have to click on a link that takes me to an external source where my pictures are held for seven days, and that is if I can view them. I cannot seem to send pictures through text either (I have only tried once). Sending and receiving pictures through text is something I thought was standard on all cell phones but apparently not. I'm disappointed big time about that. All and all I still recommend this phone. It picks up my wifi with no problem and I can sync my email to it as well. It really reminds me of my now broken Galaxy S, except for the few disappointments.",5,1,,
i absolutely positively love this phone,"I've had this phone now for 2 months and wanted to wait until i was familiar with it before i reviewed. Its not too big, not too small and just the right size, the same size as a s4 mini. I just want to thank the blu company for hookin a sister up because not only is it a great price, it comes with a free rubber case and screen protector along with standard accessories. I paid less than $100 for a phone that can perform just as good as or even better than the name brand phones. I love the way its feels in hand, how loud it is, how responsive it is, everthing! I would say i have a minor problem with the keyboard's unresponsiveness (its the keyboard, NOT THE PHONE) . However i changed this problem by downloading a free app called ""a keyboard"". It allows you to choose either qwerty or a 3×4 keyboard (which is my favorite) and you can choose backgrounds. Another thing i do not like is that the battery tends to die a little quick with playing games, watching movies, playing songs etc. and to solve this problem, i downloaded ""du battery"" app from the google play store. It tells me my battery's temperature, controls my battery power and creates a shortcut optimize button that i can press to stop background apps from killing my battery. The last thing i do not like is the screen resolution and viewing angles which seem to look a bit blurry looking from the sides of the screen. When watching movies or doing anything the screen has to be directly facing you for you to see clearly. Overall, i still give this phone 5 stars because most of my problems were able to be solved and this is way more than a bargain. I hope this review helps your decision :)",5,1,,
Great phone for the price,"This phone does everything my nexus 7 tablet does but it's a phone. I don't understand the complaints about the screen....my screen is fine. I can see what some people are talking about when you tilt it but I never would have noticed it at all if it wasn't pointed out here. Be ready for a pain in the caboose if you are going to hook it up to straight talk. I am tech savy and it still took a couple hours of messing around and calling their customer service. Once it finally got all sorted out the thing works like a charm. One thing, the ""case"" that comes with the phone is really just a skin and offers little to no protection. The kickstand case that is sold on this website is heavy duty though and not expensive. Well worth the price. In the end ,it is insane what you get with this phone for the price.....just as good as an iphone with the exception of the camera, which is just OK. Super happy with the purchase. It does seem to have a small glitch where the ringtone keeps resetting and nothing can fix it.... EDIT: Pay attention if you are trying to use this phone with straight talk and are having problems. You have to get all the APN settings correct and those can be found easily on the web. But here is the deal. Sometimes straight talk fumbles porting over the number completely and you might need to either A) Wait until your next billing cycle or B) Get another SIM card. If all of your APN settings are correct and you can't get picture or group texts, this is likely the case. IF you decide to get a new SIM card, there is a glitch with this phone where it retains the SIM profile from the first SIM put into the phone and tries to use this profile when downloading any MMS text. It is impossible to erase. It took me a lot of troubleshooting and switching various SIMs between phones to recognize this. You can tell if this is happening if the little icon next to the message you are trying to download (but can't) is different from the icon of the message you sent. For example, one will say AT T, the other will be AT T 01. Confusing huh? Anyway, solving this problem is not hard. When ever you add a new sim from the same carrier (ie a new straight talk SIM when you already had one in the phone) you HAVE TO DO A FACTORY RESET before MMS texts will work. Now that I have fixed this on my wifes phone it works like a charm. Enjoy!",5,1,,
Great Phone but you need to know this,I purchased this phone for the dual SIM - I have both work and personal USA ATT accounts so now I don't have to carry two phones with me. It worked for talk and SMS text right out of the box however you must call or chat with ATT tech support to register the IMEI number(s) on the box to connect to 3G data for the internet and multimedia texting. FYI there are two IMEI numbers on the box. The first one is for SIM #1 and the second is for SIM #2.,5,1,,
A Five-star even with issues,"The aide dropped and broke her cellphone. After considerable research on price, feature and performance, I bought the Blue Advance 4.0 Unlocked cellphone to give. She's on Simple Mobile. The unlocked GSM Quad Band phone will give her the freedom to move to another carrier without having to replace the phone. Size, weight and construction wise, it feels solid in your hand. The outer is plastic and would most likely break if you drop it. But don't worry, they included a silicon case. You don't have to spend money on a case unless you want a fancier one. You don't have to worry about buying a screen protector that would fit the phone either. One (1) screen protector is included. The back camera is 5 MP and the front camera is VGA quality. Really? Come on BLU - think high resolution Selfie. Selfie lovers want to look g..o...o....d. It has two SIM slots. Her SIM was a little smaller than the slot. When it was put in the phone did not recognized it. Aligned the SIM properly, the phone recognized it without any problem. Yes, it stayed in place once it's done properly. The marking on the SIM has SIM1 on the right and SIM2 on the left. The label has SIM 1 on the left and SIM 2 on the right (see image). Go with the marking next to the SIM slot. Two SIM slots allow you to have two phone (lines/number or carriers) - Narco dealer? or one SIM for your significant other and the other for your intimate BFF. The Micro SD slot supports 32GB. There are three issues with the WiFi. First, there is no well-defined character set for WiFi SSID. It's up to manufacturer's implementation. With that being said, I had special characters in my SSID. It seems that BLU's implementation would not accept special characters in SSID. My Hikvision security camera has the same problem as BLU. My Samsung phones accept special characters and hidden SSID. Second, forget about not broadcasting your WiFi SSID (it's not secured anyway, but why broadcast it). BLU Advance 4.0 will not connect to non-broadcasting SSID. It can't find the WiFi, even if you input the SSID and Passphrase manually. BLU needs to fix this flaw. Third, the battery drains pretty quickly if you download over WiFi; otherwise the battery last a day and a half between charges for normal use - your normal may be different from hers. Since other manufacturers have the same WiFi issues and base on price, feature and performance, I still rate the BLU Advance 4.0 a five-star buy.",5,1,,
BLU Advance 4.0,"For the price there's nothing better out there. I have zero complaints. If I needed anything to be better, I would go with a different phone. Some people complain about things, which are up to specs. If you need better screen, faster processor, more RAM, smaller or larger size, other color - just find another phone. Of course a lot of things could be better, but same goes for any phone or a car you drive,or house you live in, and everything has it's own price. As of now, I'm certain, I got the best product for my needs and my money. I am extremely happy with this purchase. BLU has my respect.",5,1,,
For the price it's a great phone.,While it's no Nexus 5 it is a great phone for the price. It's a good in almost every way with a decent screen and solid feel. Jelly Bean does the job which can be reskinned to update the dated UI. I bought three for the kids and they're great. Zero complaints. Makes for a great first smartphone considering the first one always gets trashed. Five stars not because it's a great phone but five stars because it's a good phone at a dirt cheap price. I was really surprised at the quality of this phone for the price. Well done BLU. Highly recommended.,5,1,,
Good device,"It arrived in perfect condition. Good dual SIM device that works on 3G 850/1700/1900 MHz (In Venezuela, serves to 3G Movistar and Movilnet; but only 2G in Digitel network). This phone is good for gifts to people who are not very tech-savvy. And it has Android 4.2.2 in almost pure state",5,1,,
BLU Advance 4.0 Android great choice.,"Bought the phone for International use, I have a Samsung Galaxy 4 Active with international text. I went to Argentina in January for 5 weeks took the phone with it's provided rubber cover so I could have a local number and the Samsung. Nice size, 4"" screen. Bought a sim from Personal for about $7, bought a few $50 peso use cards. Careful, calls are about 3-4 pesos a minute, text is 1 peso a text. I used wifi all over, downloaded many apps, sound was clear, music was clear. I put skype on both phones too, very clar even without the headset, I bought a 32 gb added memory card for it for just in case I took many photos. Battery life was great although I had my charger with me for both phones. The sim will not work in Uruguay or Brazil, you need others. I am taking the phone to Spain for a month in June, very pleased at my choice of purchase. I showed it to many friends with prepay service with very cheap phones, all of them ordered this and replaced their phones with this model with lots of Android features, all are very happy.",5,1,,
A surprisingly good phone for a reasonable price!,"I bought this unlocked phone to use in Rwanda when I discovered that my Verizon smart phone could not be unlocked. All of the features and apps work well: calling, texting, Google Maps, camera, email, Facebook, flashlight, etc. I have not had any problems with it at all. I use one SIM card from MTN and one from Tigo, and the SIM management settings let me choose for each function which card to use, or ""always ask"". The phone also has allows me to set an automatic power-down time at night and power-up at the time choose in the morning. This helps extend the length of a charge, and I have only had to charge every other day.",5,1,,
Best Phone for the money. Excellent Battety Life.,"This is a great phone for the money, it came w/ a screen protector and a case. It works flawlessly, and the battery last a lot longer than many other smartphones. The screen resolution is great. It came unlocked for AT & T however you will need to contact your service provider to register it before you can use the Media Messages (MMS), and your existing data plan, do not waste your time trying to go around it (i.e. changing your settings in the access point name (APN)). The phone is already set up, but you need to register it w/ the service provider i.e. AT & T for it to work properly.",5,1,,
Makes a great MP3 player!,"Don't want to spend big bucks on an iPod, purchase this inexpensive unlocked phone without all the bloatware from cell providers. Add a micro SD card and you are all set. Works like a charm and has wifi to get streaming music, videos and/or movies. Download games from Google play store too. Fast, sexy and convenient. I made this a gift for my daughter. Removed the phone and text icons and this device becomes and iPod killer. Extremely pleased so far!",5,1,,
alternative to samsung galaxy phones,"Great alternative for the samsung galaxy phones. Pro: Great alternative to samsung galaxy phones, dual sim card Cons: can not find replacement parts for this phone.",5,1,,
I love this phone!,"I've had this phone for about a month and I absolutely love it. I'm new the world of smartphones and wanted something inexpensive but that wouldn't look, feel, or act cheap. I did tons of research over the course of a few weeks and found this phone. I liked the ratings it go on other sites and with other online cell phone researchers. My husband has a Galaxy S2 and this phone does everything and more than the Galaxy does. It's very fast, I've never had a dropped call, wifi connectivity is excellent, the battery usage is great. There are 2 slots for sim cards but I only use one. There is also a slot for a micro sd card. It's extremely easy to use the phone and all of the apps I wanted were quick to download from the google play store. The screen is bright and I have had no issues with seeing it from the side as some others have said they have. I can watch videos, take great pics, take video. I have absolutely no complaints at all. I did end up buying a new screen saver as the one that came with the phone didn't work out too well for me but Amazon made that right with me. The case is fine, nothing fancy but it fits the phone and protects it. Overall, I highly recommend the phone and am considering buying a second one for a family member. I've shown the phone to several friends who are tech ""nerds"" and they love it. One of them even bought one and is thrilled with it.",5,1,,

Good Value,"I've purchase several dual sim phones, and this one has by far been the best. With others I've had issues mainly with sound, people would say I sound very muffled which is not good for business. Another issue was with having on speaker phone, which isn't an issue either w/this phone!",5,1,,
Better than I originally thought!,"I tried a smartphone before, and it was the Samsung Galaxy. When I received the Galaxy, I really was not into the smartphone thing, so I did not use it and ended up selling it. So my other (older) cell phone began to show signs of wear and tear, it was time for me to get a new cell phone. I looked around at my cell phone carriers website to see what type of phones were available, and the majority of them were smartphones. Obviously, I had no choice but to get a smartphone, and I figured I had no choice but to buy one that was expensive... they are all expensive. I hesitated a couple months, and began my search again. That is when I stumbled upon Blue Mobile Smartphones, and it was an excellent choice. I felt ambivalent because of my experience with the Galaxy smartphone I tried out. But the Blu Advance 4.0 was just my cup of tea. Blu Advance is more comfortable to hold, the screen is not too big or too small, it is very easy to operate, there are two Sim card slots available and an SD card slot micro), and it just seems like there is less intensity about it.. I do not feel overwhelmed with having a smartphone as I did with the Galaxy. And for those who are completely new to smartphones as I was (still am), think about it like its a thong.. at first you have to get used to it, then when you do, you'll wonder why you didn't switch over sooner and absolutely love it. Haha! Best phone I have used, and I will stay with BLU Mobile. ETA: I have no problem with the viewing angle. 5 stars!!",5,1,,
Possibly the best smartphone for <$100.,"This would make for a great first smartphone or low-budget phone. It runs Android 4.2 (Jellybean), has a Dual-Core processor, and half a gigabyte (512 MB) of RAM. This should be enough for basic tasks, such as business task and web browsing, and light games, like Angry Birds. Luckily, social media apps like Youtube and Facebook run perfectly on this phone. It has Bluetooth, acceptable-quality dual cameras (the outer camera has a flashlight) with video recording, and it comes with a silicon case, a pair of earbuds, and a screen protector. The phone itself is thicker than most smartphones like this, but it feels sturdy and high-quality. The back of the phone looks gorgeous, but it attracts fingerprints like moths to a flame, so I recommend using the case that comes with it. The case doesn't just look good and prevent fingerprints, it actually protects the phone! I can't tell you how many times I dropped this phone over the 4 months I've had it expecting it to be ruined, and picking it up to find that it has sustained no damage at all! The phone has a micro-sd card slot (it can accept up to 32 GB), and I highly recommend picking one up with the phone (I got a Kingston 8GB card for $5). Overall, this phone has a high-quality build, acceptable specs, expandable memory, sleek design, and is probably the best smartphone you can buy for less than $100. Oh, I forgot to mention that this device is unlocked, so it can be used with most carriers (including the more popular ones, like T-Mobile and AT&T).",5,1,,
Wonderful! Two small caveats...,"So I'll be honest, even after I picked this phone out after shopping online, I still wasn't very excited about it. I was not crazy about it. BUT then it came in the mail and I'm in love! The phone is beautiful as is everything that comes on it! I really could not be happier. Plus all the things you get in the box is pretty neat. I am so happy with this purchase! Two things though I want to mention just because I didn't see them mentioned before: 1. The phone does a short little vibrate when your call is connected (either the person answers or you're sent to voicemail) and there is no way to turn it off. 2. The front-facing camera is not the best quality. It works just fine for things like snapchat and Skype, but just a heads up to people that use it religiously and a little less than average camera quality would be a deal-breaker.",5,1,,

the phone is excellent. What I liked most was the ability to ...,"Purchased this for month long travel in Australia. Buy a Telstra sim card, not Vodafone for complete coverage in Australia. Either way, the phone is excellent. What I liked most was the ability to use phone as a hotspot. My girlfriend and I were able to then use our tablets separately and connection was no problem. The camera is pretty decent but that's not why I bought the phone. In terms of making calls, texting, researching on the internet, GoogleMap (huge plus when you're touring on a bicycle), Skyping, and even reading my Kindle book...the phone rocked. I would almost use it as my full-time phone if I didn't already have US phone. For the price, this phone is an excellent value.",5,1,,

A great phone,"I am not a phone expert nor specialist. I just use it. This white Blu Advance 4 phone feels good in the hand, it is pretty. It is light weight. It comes with all you can expect from a smartphone. Android 4 is user friendly. Booklet instructions are easy to follow. It came with earphones, a protective screen, a rubber case and a USB cable and sector battery charger. It instantly.connected to my home WIFI and to my network (discount Blackwireless provider connecting to the AT&T network), Great phone features. All works fine. More expert phone users around me say it is a great phone. Factory unlocked, it comes with a US warranty.",5,1,,
Don't let the pricetag scare you,"I like it better than my Samsung or my HTC at a fraction of the cost. Great picture. Touchscreen works well. Plenty of processor power to run any of the apps I want to use. Two small problems that I don't really think are a problem. It doesn't come with much memory but that's ok, I put a 32GB chip in and have more than enough space. And, the camera is a little lacking. At 5mp it is adequate but I had gotten used to the higher resolution of the Samsung. Works just fine but not as crisp. Other than those little things, it's an incredible bargain for sure.",5,1,,
Great Buy!,"The design, functionality and usability of this Blu Phone is comparable to any other expensive branded phone. It works great! Its easy to use, the screen is crystal clear and it came with accessories that I didn't have to pay for but would sorely need to protect the phone. Its stylish and I love it! Why would I pay more for a phone, this was seriously a wholesale price. It does everything the other phones do at a better price. I'm glad I bought it.",5,1,,
Excellent phone,"I wanted a replacement for an old Nexus One and this one has been excellent, so far. The size (4"") is very convenient (it fits in your pocket, not as the 5-inch ones) and it even comes with a screen protector and a nice case. The only aspect that I feel not comfortable with is the internal storage; the specifications state that it has 4 GB of internal space, but you actually get only about 1.3 GB of free space. Anyway I got an additional 8GB-memory for storing additional data and it works fine. Be very careful while installing the sd card; the tray has to be pulled very carefully and it seems very fragile, but since you usually don't change the memory very often (or almost never) it is not a problem at all.",5,1,,
Surprisingly Good!,"With the advent of mobile carriers changing their ""upgrade"" options, I was looking for an unlocked phone. This phone does everything the Big Name Android phones do. I've had no problems with service, connection speed, apps, phone, messaging or email. In fact the version of android that it runs is newer than the big name phone I got last year runs. When I brought it to my carrier to get a sim card they were pretty impressed as well, having seen some ""aftermarket"" phones, they had never seen the ""BLU"" and after playing with it for a while were very impressed, especially when I told them of the price. NO MORE UPGRADE SCAMS for this guy, as the rest of my family needs new phones I'll order another BLU. My only regret is not getting the bigger one. But for $80 it was worth the gamble.",5,1,,
Gift for my sister,I bought this phone for one of my sisters.Had great feedback from the one I bought for my husband so I got her the same phone just got it in white.Delivery was fast and I can say I'm pleased with this purchase and so is she.,5,1,,
... using it with my 2 sim cards and works great!!,"been using it with my 2 sim cards and works great!!!!!!! wi-fi connect fast... easy to download apps, lots of memory left after transfer all my contacts. thinking to buy another one for my wife",5,1,,
excellent price quality.,"The phone is very good WONDERFUL HOTEL. Quite fast, Wheel comes with its manuals intact protective silicon case and screen protector, despite having only 512 ram is pretty fast and has the capabilities of a high end phone. Works great with both sim in Venezuela.",5,1,,
yes,is a good phone do not have anything to envy to other excellent recommend with eyes closed I'm very happy thanks,5,1,,
Best Value,"Best price for an unlocked new phone. Good looking easy to use with dual SIM, can be used international. May not have all the bells and whistles compared to other high priced phones, but with Android 4.2, Wi-Fi, 5mp camera, 4GB (1.23GB actual) memory, can use up to 32GB micro SD for additional storage, I am getting all I wanted. Comes with a case and screen protector which I never heard of. Bottom line: very good phone for starters for regular use with very attractive price.",5,1,,
Nice Alternative to Samsung Galaxy S4,"Bought this phone for my grandmother. It's super similar to a samsung galaxy s4 but for a fraction o the cost. Just beware that you can't use these phones with the Verizon network. Excellent little phone though, she has had no problems with it and it's been at least 6 months since we bought it.",5,1,,
Awesome for an economy phone,"I got this phone in an emergency, because my old phone died and I needed a basic replacement in a hurry before I got my new phone in the fall. I love this phone as a basic phone. This may be the best economical phone that there is! It's true, that this is very slow, but besides this phone being slow, it's pretty awesome! And, not all parts are slow, I'm able to text and unlock it with the speed of a very quick phone. I just can't play very many games on it. This ended up being great, because I'm vacationing in Nicaragua next month, so I've been trying to learn Spanish, and I've been using mainly Duolingo on this phone. And, it's awesome at Duolingo, and other lightweight applications. The GPS on this phone actually worked better than it does with all of my other phones, which was pretty awesome. I also like that it's small and easy to hold. Most phones are a little too big, and this one is perfect. It fits in my pocket without bulging. It's thin, but not too thin, too, so for me, it's a perfect size. It takes the giant SIM cards, so I had to get an extender so that my regular SIM card would fit, but it ended up working out great. I could have gone to T-Mobile to get a new SIM card, but they charge me for everything. And, it takes two SIM cards. There are a ton of features about what to use with what. So, you can use data only with one SIM and phone only with the other SIM, if you want. And, you can switch back and forth with an Android setting, if you want, too. I wasn't able to test this out, since I just have one SIM, but the interface looks cool. There's not much space on this, only about 1GB free when you start, so you'll need to watch the memory closely, and get an SD card where you push most of your stuff to. And, it's stuck on Android 4.2. There was one update, but it just updated it to another version of Android 4.2. Oh, and something else that i loved, is that it has a reboot option. With most Androids, you can't just reboot, so I love Blu for including this. I have to warn you again that it's slow. To get the most out of this phone, make sure that you don't have very much installed, and get a task killer to use before you need any kind of performance. But the slowness is all usually in between application switches, and with it doing things more slowly than other phones. This is basically like a Yaris with four big people in it, and 500 lbs in the trunk. It will go, but won't go up hills very fast. And, just like the Yaris, I love this phone! Overall, this is awesome. And, if you're okay with a slower phone, this would be a great phone. I used it for a month before i got my new Moto G, and now I'm going to keep it as a backup phone, or if a friend loses a phone. And, this would be an awesome phone for a child or a mom who keeps breaking or losing their phone. And, I'm a 43-year old man, and it was a great phone for me, too.",5,1,,
Great Android phone.,Great phone. I like it especially for its dual sim which makes it unnecessary to take along two different phones with me. It works very well here in Jamaica. I think was a good deal. Google Play store allows me to download the apps that I need. I added 8 gig SD card which is enough added storage for me. So far the phone is working well. Takes good pictures too.,5,1,,
Great Value,"Awesome phone for the price! it is fast enough for me, i have downloaded a lot of apps and it still runs ok, the only ''con'' is that both cameras are quite dark, it has to be really clear and sunny to get a good photo, but the rest is ok",5,1,,
Great Phone for the Price,"Very happy with this purchase. Per other reviews, the major drawbacks for the phone are poor images with the front facing camera, a screen that smudges easily, and the limited viewing angle. However, as my wife pointed out, the viewing angle can also be seen as a plus (similar to a built-in privacy screen). The other drawback I noticed is that the instruction book is fairly sparse. For anyone setting up the phone for the first time, the back cover snaps off (rather than slides off) and the holder for the mini-SD card slides over (I cannot remember if it was right or left) and then pops up. Neither of these things were clear in the instruction book and took a few minutes for me to figure out. Other than those three things, everything else about the phone is great. Good response time for navigating and opening apps, taking pictures, and loading internet pages. The phone also takes good pictures with the rear-facing camera (at least as good as can be expected for a 5 megapixel cell phone camera), has clear calls, looks/feels good, and has a decent amount of storage space. It even has some added features I was not expecting (e.g., built-in video calling capability and a camera app that automatically takes pictures whenever a smile is detected). Given all this, plus add in items that come with the phone (screen protector and phone case), plus the price, I think the phone is an outstanding value. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a less-expensive, highly-functional android phone.",5,1,,
Dual SIM feature works in USA and New Zealand,"This dual SIM GSM BLU Advance phone rocks. I use it in California with AT&T Wireless with a SIM is slot #1. I just took it to New Zealand and installed a 2-Degrees Wireless SIM in slot #2 with a local New Zealand cell phone number. (I bought the SIM from The Warehouse store near Auckland international airport) With a free call to 2-Degrees support to activate the account and to download an app for data compatibility, the phone was able to operate on the New Zealand system. The SIMs can be each toggled on/off, and both can be active at the same time. In the System Settings, SIM Management menu, I was able to easily pick which SIM handled outgoing calls, data, and text messages. To avoid AT&T roaming costs, I chose to set all outbound activity to 2-Degrees, It worked! (And there is an ""always ask"" feature available). SIM #1 on AT&T Wireless was able to receive USA-originated calls in New Zealand made using the USA-based phone number, and SIM #2 on 2-Degrees was able to receive calls and texts from New Zealand and the USA using the NZ-based phone number. Quite impressive for such an inexpensive device. Definitely has exceeded expectations.",5,1,,
Very pleased with phone,Excellent value for the money. only complaint is network capability is 4G NOT 4GLTE. There is a difference and AT&T skipped over 4G so I only can use 3G. I know this is confusing but still a very nice phone.,5,1,,
android phone,"excellent wonderful product for the price you are paying. I have studied bad and good reviews. screen is very reasonably good. extra battery is available on amazon.com. front camera is very reasonable. inserting/removing sim card is slightly difficult like other phones.TO INSERT SD CARD YOU HAVE TO SLIDE DOWN SILVER PLAT AND OPEN IT. THEN PLACE SD CARD AND CLOSE THE SILVER PLATE. SLIDE THE SAID PLAT UP TO LOCK , To insert sim card, just slide THE RIGHT SIZE CARD BELOW SILVER PLATE IN RIGHT DIRECTION SHOWN WITH ARROW. software and phone signal is as good as my $500 Samsung android phone. sd card is MUST to work phone more efficiently. sd card available on amazon for 10 dollars. note: silicone case, charger,protective film,earphone and battery comes with phone.",5,1,,
great purchase - BLU smart phone,"I had purchased another smart phone first but had all kinds of problems and eventually had to return it. I then found the BLU 4.0 unlocked phone on Amazon. It came the next day and the price was very good. I set it up and connected it to my AT&T account and it worked on the first try. The price was excellent and one by one I activated all (well not all yet because there are tons of functionality) the options and they were easy to activate and they all work fine. The phone is light and attractive, came with its own protective shell and screen protector. It is pretty amazing - I will never use all its capabilities but it is all I need and more. This was an excellent purchase. For about $75 got the equivalent of the $500 plus phones advertised all over. Bill",5,1,,
Why spend more?,"Second smartphone purchase on Amazon after trying a Samsung with smaller screen. This one was even cheaper, but way, way better. It is on the hefty side, and comes with decent screen protector and plastic case. Switching out the SIMS and SD card is not an issue...it's also easy to manage the presence of 2 SIMs when travelling...simple to shut one off to save roaming or leave both on, for example. Battery life was about a day to day and a half but charging is fast. As others have pointed out, this is a great phone for travel, and it does what the others do for much less. Here in the US, it works fine on the T-Mobile network for voice, text and data. I would definitely look at BLU products in the future if they maintain this quality and practicality.",5,1,,
For the price you can't go wrong!,"For the price you can't go wrong. Feels substantial and solid, but not too heavy. Well made, very nice details. All the parts fit together nicely. Fit and finish are well above average. Camera is a bit cheesy, doesn't seem to be 5 megapixels, also doesn't seem to auto focus but then again, I don't use the camera in a cellphone. I have two SIM cards installed, T-mobile and AT&T, both work well. The antenna in this cellphone seems pretty strong, I was never able to receive calls at work on T-mobile with my previous cellphone but now the calls come through albeit, the signal is still weak but workable. Wi-Fi works very well. Also has Bluetooth and GPS which also work well. I'm very pleased with this cellphone.",5,1,,
This is an upgrade to him it has more rom and ram than his last phone and also has a better processor. The reviews for this prod,Bought this awhile back for my 12 yr old son. His other phone broke and while he is somewhat responsible I didn't want to spend a lot of money for a replacement for him. This is an upgrade to him it has more rom and ram than his last phone and also has a better processor. The reviews for this product on Amazon were very good so I thought I would give it a shot. This phone exceeded my expectations and has been a great phone for my son. I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a cheap alternative to the more expensive brands.. This phone is used with Straight Talk BYOP plan and we have not had any problems. Put the sim in set his account and added the APN everything works as it should.,5,1,,
Great phone.,"I've had this phone for several months and I'm extremely pleased with it. Great features, crisp, clear calls, great battery life and absolutely cannot beat the price. As silly as it sounds, I love the message indicator light that lets you know you have a message without actually having to turn your screen on. The ONLY complaints I would have about it is that the screen is a little difficult to view when you hold the phone horizontally to play a game or watch a video. Think it's the screen polarization. The SD expansion slot is also little flimsy, but certainly not a deal breaker. Great phone. Buy it and spend the money you saved on something else.",5,1,,
great phone,"I actually bought this phone else where but it's a great phone that is awesome for another 90% of users. Most people only txt, browse internet, and call (probably in that order) so I've never understood their need for a super powerful phone...anyway if you are an average user you will not be disappointed with this phone. Just a side note on the memory, I saw a review stating that phone companies ""scam"" you by saying the phone capacity is 16 or 8 GB but not all that is available. Not a scam. On a 16GB maybe 14.8GB will be available but you also need to consider the OS and pre-installed apps which bring you to about 10GB.",5,1,,
Does the job and more for my 8 year old son,"I purchased the BLU advance 4.0 phone for my son to use. He is only 8 years old and I have T-mobile. 4 lines for $100 a month. unlimited everything so I never have to worry about going over anything. This phone works great. It looks very much like the Samsung Galaxy S3 or S4 but 1/3 the price. hahahaha. I also picked up a set of NuclearAV headphones and it pairs up with this phone via bluetooth. It sounds great and even better with this phone. My son uses the phone to make calls, play math games, and listen to music.",5,1,,

Nice phone,"I have had it about a month now, still figuring it out, works fine. The date on the screen for Nov. 15th 2015 (example) is 15-11-2015, I have tried everything in settings, can't change it. I switched from an iphone to this android, it's much lighter. Aside from the date issue I am very happy with the phone. Now we realize how overpriced/inflated the price was from the major carriers for years. If anyone has been able to change the date on the home screen please let me know.",5,1,,
Really good budget phone; surprisingly high quality,"...or high quality dedicated device for playing Spotify to my bluetooth speakers and doubling as an e-reader. I don't actually use this device as a phone; rather I run it on wifi at my residence, where is serves as an electronic swiss army knife of sorts. Surprisingly high quality; it even comes with earphones and a screen protector. Keep in mind that is still a <$100 smartphone, so doesn't expect it to be a Moto X or iPhone.",5,1,,
They work great and the Android system means there are plenty of ...,This phone got my son to stop bugging me for an iPhone. We have 3 of them now and have had for about 6 months. They work great and the Android system means there are plenty of Google apps available. I'm sure the iPhone has a better screen and a faster processor etc - but compare the price! We can do everything we want with it. My son can stream Netflix and play Madden NFL along with lots of other stuff. So far we love it.,5,1,,
"""Are you kiddin me.. for the price, this phone is great""","I'm not sure what phone these people got that are rating it only one or two stars but, after have this only a few days now, I can say that for a ""smart phone"" that is only about 20% of the cost of the Samsung 4 (and many others) ... might I add that is also unlocked and has the operating features that it has... this phone is awesome! Sure preforms to any expectations that I had for it anyway!!",5,1,,

I like the phone,"I like the phone, it is what I expected, because before to buy I did a full research and I found that the camera it's not great and how works the screen, I was fully aware of all the pros and cons of this product because I think that if you gonna buy something, you not only have to guide for this reviews, it's obvious. Saying that, I think that it's a good product with a good price and works fine.",5,1,,
Seems as good as the more celebrated brands,"Bought this for my 14 year old daughter last Christmas.

Great Phone for the money,"great phone for no real money, I bought it because my 8 yr daughter lost her phone (GS2 I had) and she had this one for emergencies and the only internet I let her use was wifi when at home or my office. It worked so well that when my son dropped his GS2 and broke the screen I bought one of these for the same price it was going to cost me to fix the GS2.",5,1,,
Great phone!,"I tired a Windows phone and couldn't stand it, so I bought this one to replace it and it came so fast. Android has all the apps I love and they download within a minute. One of the things I love about this phone is the battery! It'll easily last all day( I use my phone quite a bit), at the end of the day it'll be between 50-60% and I never need to charge it! Also charges incredibly fast! It was at 73% after I charged it for around 20 minutes it was at 88% The only complaints I have is that the audio jack and charging are on the top of the phone, and whenever I get a notification a small green or red light flashes to the right of the receiver, and the back of the phone is a little slippery, but the case it comes with fixes that. Nothing I can't get used to!",5,1,,

For 82 dollars is a good phone,"It is a good phone, light, good screen, it's quick, good signal, the battery lasts about 8 hours with heavy use and about 15 hours with average use.

Love this little guy,"I received this Blu Advance 4.0 and was not expecting much from the sub $100 buy. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. I checked out both the SIM slots and it works. I like the SIM card management functionality. This will come in handy when I am traveling. I have turned off the second sim to save battery and left the card in. I am assuming if both are on it may use more battery. So far I am happy with the phone functionality as far as making and receiving calls. I was thinking of picking up a armor case for it, and since there is no exact match in the dollar store (no i don't want to pay $40 for a silly silicone case at the dept store those are for ppl who buy the $400 iPhone :) ), I have a feeling the Samsung galaxy 4 case will be a fit and the camera opening seems to match. But I may just leave it as is with the case that came with it. I played a full 720p movie from the SD card. I had the airplane mode on just to check how much battery will be used in that scenario on a long flight. The battery indicator didnt budge. So I am thinking it should hold good for a long flight.",5,1,,

Works for me,"I purchased this phone to replace an i-phone 4.5 locked to an ATT account I share with my family. I had no problem with the service, but I could not straighten out my identity with Apple and did not especially enjoy using that phone. I am spending increasing time in Mexico and the purpose of choosing this device was to allow me to develop a Mexican contact list and use a local number when traveling there. I have not tried this yet, but will be looking into it on my next visit in October. However, since receiving it I feel as though I should rate it based on my experience so far, and if it accomplishes my objective of maintaining a Mexican contract in addition to my ATT account I can avoid all kinds of cellular data and roaming charges.But that would be a bonus, because I have found one important use for this phone that was nonexistant in my i-phone (though some might consider that I did not know how t, and its apps, properly). Sorry, my technical expertise is limited. I enjoy listening to audiobooks on my Kindles, and since I put a 32 gig chip into the new phone (about $11 additional) I have found that I can now store and listen to all the books I want, using that device and, if interrupted by a call, get back to what book or lesson was playing at the time. This is especially convenient when walking in the park. The phone comes with a case and headphones (I tossed the glass protector) the first of which, though appearing flimsy functions adeaquetly and the headphones are a bit cheesy and the answer call button not always responsive. I have not tried the camera as I do not use my phones for photography. I also do not do any gaming and have not downloaded music though it does have a nice radio app allowing me to listen to my favorite FM station. I regret that it did not have an instruction booklet or webpage I could find with such instructions, and I needed to visit the ATT store a few times to learn some basic functions, but that was not burdensome. My contacts list was incorporated flawlessly (except the alphabetizing was different) and I have generally had an easy time using the device. I am looking forward with intererst to see how it does in Mexico.",5,1,,
It's great for skinflints who aren't power-users,"Delivered quickly and product was in good shape upon receipt. I think the phone is excellent for the price, but a little disclosure: my old samsung gravity cost me nearly three times as much as this BLU, and it bricked up within a year. Couldn't do much more than talk/text/email, but since I didn't have money to spend on another expensive model, I learned to make do and just use it less for two more years. Well, it finally died and my carrier does not do free upgrades. I figured, if I'm only going to use a phone for talk, text, GPS, and e-mail, might as well go cheap. I also figured, if I spent $100 or less on something that would brick up on me within the year, well that's still better than spending nearly 3 times as much for a higher-end product to do the same (and to keep making monthly payments to my carrier on a phone I hardly use). Because I have been so snakebitten by owning a crummy, yet expensive, piece of non-functioning junk for so long, this phone seems like the greatest android device on the planet -- so take my comments in their proper context. I am more than thrilled with the performance of my Advance, but I have also never owned a really expensive top-of-the-line phone. And now, I never will. Had no problem getting it to work on T-mobile, just had to call to have them activate it. Works great so far, no problems with the cameras, call quality is good, the screen works fine as long as you're looking straight at it - and come on, people, how ELSE are you supposed to look at your phone? -- no bugginess, battery lasts long, really easy to navigate and not full of irremovable bloatware. Was a nice touch that they threw in a free case, screen protector, and earphones. Some people apparently have gotten lemons that failed on them. That, unfortunately, happens, but it can also happen with a more established manufacturer's model, as with my old phone. Maybe others who have given bad reviews were expecting their BLU to be an iPhone or Galaxy clone, and it's not, so no surprise that they've been disappointed. Depends on what you want to do with yours, I guess. But if you are cheap like me and are a moderate user, this should be your phone. Only regret afterwards is that I didn't shell out a tad more money for one of their 5-inch screen models, which wouldn't have been a huge jump in price, and the 4.5 inch model (Neo) appears to be cheaper! Will def buy again, probably soon when my wife's over-priced samsung stops working.",5,1,,
Unlocked & ready to be used overseas,I purchased this phone to use with the NuclearAV wireless bluetooth headphones. They work great together. Since this phone was unlocked I was able to pop in a sim card to use in France. They have Orange mobile over there.,5,1,,
Very good Standard Android phone working fine with Ptel Mobile.,I bought this for the wife who was already familiar with using an Android tablet so this was not much of a learning curve for her to use as her first Smart Phone. I got this to work with Our Ptel sim cards and setup was as easy as taking the sim out of her old flip phone and sliding it into this one. I also added a 8GB micro SD card for apps and things. Everything here is pretty standard Android fare so using the phone is nothing new to those familiar with Android. The phone seems to get a good signal and she hears callers clearly and they hear her clearly as well. Texting for her is now a breeze compared to her old flip phone. Instead of upping the cost of running the phone with just a standard text and talk plan (5 bucks a month on average) I hooked it up to our wireless at home with no problem and it seems to have no issues maintaining a good wifi signal in the home. Setting it to use the SD card for apps and storage was an easy thing to change in the settings. It takes pictures that look fine.. I'm wondering if everyone that bought the phone found the clear plastic over the lens when it arrives.. it would be easy to miss. Although not as good a camera as the 5MP camera on our ASUS tablets.. it's fine for a phone and better than most. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a good android phone and not wanting to spend big bucks to do it.,5,1,,

I Love my Blu Advance 4.0!!,"Replaced by blackberry with this and I don't regret it. Downloaded the BB messenger app and all my contacts come over. Great price, Responds well, No hangups thus far and access to the Google Play Store. Picks up wireless clearly even various hotspots as I am driving around. The free screen guard is not the best. The tab was practically glued to the guard and I was left with glue residue after trying to scratch the tab off. Then air bubbles was a nightmare. Had to purchase the EZGuardz to do the job. No big deal, most phones don't come with a screen guard. The silicone case isn't bad but I purchased a more sturdier one with a kickstand to really protect my phone if dropped. No Issues with dual sims. Battery life depends on my usage and running apps. I could get a day and a half, maybe a bit more with minimum usage and apps running in the background. However, with frequent usage, of magicjack etc..sometimes by afternoon I'm down to 50% or less. If its affordability and functionality you are looking for then the Blu is it. Everyone who sees mine can't keep their hands off and wants one. GREAT phone! Great buy!",5,1,,

On a second look from a different page there isn't a limitation. Anyway...phone is described well, I got what I expected. My comparison would be to Galaxy S2 , phone I upgraded from. BLU is smaller, and seems to have a slightly smaller screen so check out a galaxy s2 and figure half inch in length and quarter inch in width smaller. Interface seems simple compared to Galaxy which obviously came with more options but was also much slower in comparison. This phone will serve me well in Europe as it is unlocked, it has 2 sims so two lines?....gunna have to try this out....perfect phone for a private line and a business one no? It definitely seems worth the money , but only time will tell. If I had to buy again, Id go with the larger ones from BLU, theyre only 20-40 buks more but have much larger screens.",5,1,,

I wasted my money on the bring your own phone plan,"I already have a straight talk account. I tried to activate this phone I verified with straight talk. You get two IMEI numbers, because of the dual sims. I tried both numbers with my zip code, and it says it is not available in my area. I was not able to register it. The phone I am currently using runs off a Sprint tower. This phone wants to connect to AT&T. I swapped sim cards, and then my phone wants to connect to T mobile. I wasted my money on the bring your own phone plan. I should have looked for the one which connects with Sprint, because that seems to be what Straight Talk wants for my zip code. Either way it was the IMEI number it rejected, and refused to register. We all know how easy it is to get great customer service from Straight talk! lol Good luck :)",5,1,,
A real deal at less than 70 dollars,"I am impressed with both the performance and quality of this smartphone for less than $100.00. I refused to spend hundreds of dollars for a phone and tried to find a smartphone that both looked good and had excellent performance. After wasting time on some other models (that left me disappointed) I ordered this phone. The phone works well, looks good, has a perfect size to fit in a pocket. I also think the phone operation is very intuitive. It's very easy to operate and set up. For example adding, editing and deleting contacts and phone numbers. Because this phone is priced under 100 dollars I give it a 5 star rating. Even if I had paid 150 dollars I would have rated it 4 stars. I am more than pleased. All my expectations were met and exceeded.",5,1,,
Good value basic smart phone,"This replace the Orion S350 I originally purchased for my wife to provide her with a basic smart phone. It is a bit larger and a bit heavier (the battery), It's nice that Blu has a line of outer protector so if the smoke colored one doesn't fit your fancy you can get another color. I purchase a pink one which goes nice with the white of the phone case and fits like a glove. Something I couldn't find for the Orion S350. Overall so far it's a nice mid range smart phone that conforms to the Android platform requirement better, she now has both Skype and Yahoo mail something I couldn't get the Orion S350 to install due to space limits (yes I had a SD). I will provide an update as I find out how well this phone holds up.",5,1,,

We didn't want to pay another bill, so this was perfect. The sound is really good and loud so he loves listening to music on rhapsody and on youtube. The screen is really neat and looks like it is in 3d, similar to the screen on the 3ds so you can download free 3d games on the Google play store or play them in 2d as well.

What I needed the BLU Advance for was to be able to connect to my home and work computers by WiFi and transfer files between all of them, in fact using it as a very fast flash drive (3 gigs per minute) and to use the internet while walking around.So I got a very old T-Mobile SIM card put it in an I now have a fully operational device.",5,1,,

Great phone for travel,"Excellent cheap phone. I purchased this to use in Thailand, since Sprint prevents US customers from unlocking their phones. The software is a little dated and the touch screen not as responsive as it could be, but hey, for $80 what do you expect? I'd much rather buy this cheap, but new phone than a refurbished/used and unlocked Galaxy or iPhone. Refurbished phones are bad news - I've used 2 of them, and both died within a year of purchase. My new phones, however? Still going after 3 years. Now I will be using this phone as my ""travel phone"" - thanks BLU!",5,1,,

Not all the time but most. Could not with other phones I had. I can get WiFi just speeding down road. I would buy another BLU later with bigger screen. Just wish that they offered same warranty, longer. Pray if a problem they will stand behind product.",5,1,,
I have to say that I am more than pleased with this phone,"Out of the box and running, I have to say that I am more than pleased with this phone! Price is on point (and HALF of what I paid for a used late model name brand) Performance is on point (and TWICE of that other used late model) Frustration is minimal (and you guessed it - none of that which I experience with the other used late model) Of course time will tell how well this unit performs, but thus far I am more than satisfied with this purchase. Wish I would have gone this route the first time... Dang name branding! Never again!",5,1,,
BLU smart phones rule...,You can't beat a Blu cellphone for the money. So what if the case is made out of plastic instead of metal. Once you put it in the silicone case it's still protected the same as a Samsung. This is the 2nd Blu phone in my family and I won't buy anything else. I had an expensive LG phone that was good until I dropped it and the repair shop wanted $80 to replace the glass screen. I figured that buying a new phone for $69 was a better way to go and I was right. The bottom line is that there is NO REASON to spend more than $100 for a quality smart phone.,5,1,,

Best of all, I love cutting the high priced monthly $150 Verizon bills down to over half not to mention the flexibility of shopping for the best plan from a choice of GSM carriers.

I can use both sims, and on top of that, it is well made (have dropped it several times with no problems) and does everything that a Samsung will do, unlocked, without a contract, and at a bargain price. The ONLY noteworthy problems are that the front-facing camera is poor quality and the video quality is kind of weird. When watching videos in landscape, you have to hold the picture farther away from your eyes or tilt it slightly in order to get a clear picture. So, if you plan on watching long movies on your phone, maybe go with something else. Otherwise, for the price you can't do any better.",5,1,,

*Great* basic android phone,"Nothing beats this phone in bang for the buck, unless you're willing your luck on craigslist or ebay. Came with a screen protector and a case, as well as a wall charger.

The processor and hardware is speedy enough to handle most business tasks (Calendar, email, interface flows smoothly). Nothing amazing, but no lag, which is better than I expected. It accepted a generic, bottom of the barrel 32gb MicroSD card without a problem. Dual sim is great, I use it with two contract t-mobile sim cards and everything works like a charm; data, texting, voicemail and all. Android 4.2 is a good bonus. Browses the net and Facebook no worse than most mid-range phones for half the price. Really good as a basic smartphone or for business. Battery life is great, haven't benchmarked it yet but it is better than most. I would definitely recommend Blu to others.",5,1,,

Perfect for newcomers and kids,"This is the perfect phone for a kid or someone who is getting started in the ""connected life"". I bought it for my mom, since she is finally getting rid of her five year old ""cant-even-open-a-webpage-anymore"" Blackberry. I've had android cell phones since the 1.5 Cupcake version, and let me tell you this is a nice android experience, no useless manufacturer skin overlay, the phone has almost-stock Android Jelly Bean, and let me tell you it performs really fast, fast as a more expesive phone sometimes can't. The cameras and processor are really good for a phone at this price range, the design is very common, as seen on other Android phones (I'm looking at you Samsung), a little rounded and very ergonomic, although it feels a little weak because of the materials used (cheap plastic) but it compensates with an included screen protector and a case that would keep the phone safe on the event of a drop. It also includes a very nice set of hand-free headphones, of the ""canal"" type with awesome ear tips replacements because god and the manufacturers know we usually get those lost Apps run swiftly, even 3D games (I tested it with Subway Surfers) and you can enjoy from all the benefits of the Google Play Store and the Google apps like Maps, YouTube, Google Now and so on. What i didn't like was the screen viewing angles, if you take a glimpse at it from the side, its like someone applied a Negative filter on the entire phone; That's not a deal breaker though, because looking directly on front of it, the image quality is good enough, and hey! look at the price tag, c'mon.",5,1,,

Consumer Cellular messaging and web settings,"I purchased this phone for my mom, when we switched from Sprint to Consumer Cellular to save (a LOT of) money. Mom is technically challenged, and I thought an android would be easier than her old flip phone to learn to message the family. At first, we had lots of problems with web and messaging. I spent an evening searching the web, and not finding a working answer. Finally, out of frustration, I went to the Consumer Cellular site and clicked on Support/Phones and Service. At the top, it said, ""I have a non-Consumer Cellular phone. How do I set up messaging and web access."" Wallah! I clicked on it and found the 3G settings that got her up and running. The phone is great for the price. The only thing I dislike is the emoticons. It uses the old green Droid icons. It's difficult to see the expressions they convey, so they aren't very helpful. I could use a different messaging app, but for mom, it's fine. I recommend this phone to those that don't want to pay for all the bells and whistles.",5,1,,

Best budget smartphone yet.,"Good features and performs very well for the price. Reception is good and gets better signal than previous unlocked phone (generic i9300). Android 4.2 works well on the phone. Using a 16gb micro SD card with this phone - no issues there. If my kids get a hold of it I have a hard time getting it back. Bought a second phone for the family. It does come with quite a bit in the box; rubberized cover, screen protector, charger, earphones, etc. Best budget unlocked phone I have found so far. Only issue I have is the lack of options for a belt clip for this phone. Currently using one meant for a S3 mini, which almost fits the phone.",5,1,,

"0 has a horrible camera, so it is definitely not for the ...","My nine year old daughter needed a cell phone. We decided that she a smartphone would be more convenient for her, so we got her this smartphone. The BLU Advance 4.0 has a horrible camera, so it is definitely not for the avid Instagrammer. The phone rarely freezes unlike most cheap smart phones because my daughter doesn't run multiple applications at a time. If you are deciding between the Moto G, Moto E, and this BLU phone, I would suggest the Moto G and E for people who want a ""real"" smartphone.",5,1,,

Great Value,"I can't say too much about this phone because I bought it for my daughter when she went to University. What I can say is, it must be incredible value because after a few weeks she asked me to buy her another one, she had sold hers for more than I paid for it new. I got her a new one and the same again after a few weeks. After her third she opened her own Amazon account and has bought another 2 since :) She said she loves it and it would seem that many of her fellow students do too.",5,1,,

Grandma Proof,"We got this for my mother in law, because she wanted a smart phone that was easier to use. She still has it and it still works great for her. Very few complaints about Facebook not loading, or weird icons appearing that she can't get rid of. Oh and she loves the camera for taking pictures of the grandkids, because they don't have to hold still for her to get a decent picture. Also the screen is big enough she doesn't have to put her glasses on to see the icons.",5,1,,

Until now...,"There's nothing wrong with this cellphone until now. Its size its comfortable to the hand, using it in regular situation is fast. And brings a lot of things in the box with it. I like it.. If something bad happens I'll post it :D Ah.. And it's super cheap!",5,1,,
Great Phone,I have owned the Galaxy S3 for two years and I purchased this phone for my wife. I can notice a little difference in the speed and it is much easier to type on the S3. But for only $100 the differences are negligible.,5,1,,
Great!!,"This is the best cell phone I have bought, It's like any other high-class cell phone, Android is just the best",5,1,,

"After less than 2 weeks, black lines on screen",I decided to buy this phone for myself while studying abroad in Chile. I need it mostly for using Google Maps and WhatsApp. It was very difficult to use the stock keyboard so I downloaded SwiftKey and that solved most of my problems. I used to have a galaxy s3 so learning to type on this phone was a challenge. It only recognizes one tap at a time so typing quickly and zooming in or out is a challenge.,1,0,,0.726961158
Dead!!! in less then 3 months!!,Have owned this phone for less then 90 days and it's dead!!! Has not been dropped or wet. Can't find any information on a warranty period (my mistake) and recommend to others to consider the warranty period before purchasing this phone.,1,0,,
"Decent phone, poor screen","Pros: - Price - Android operating system - Comes with accessories Cons: - Weird reflective screen - Touch screen doesn't always recognize touch - Front camera is not very good For the price, it is a decent smartphone. The only big concerns I have for it are the screen. The screen has this weird reflective property that is I can only describe as similar to those weird 3D images that change from side to side where the color gets all weird and inverted (will try to attach pictures). It is more noticeable for darker colors and if the phone is held sideways or at an angle. Not too noticeable if you are looking straight at your phone but I tend to lay my phone flat on a desk while playing games or watching a show and at this angle it makes the screen and colors look weird. The phone also is not as touch sensitive as my other phones. I often try to press a button with my finger and it won't press, or try to slide the screen and it won't slide. I think it has to do with pressure, I have to apply more pressure than I did with my iphone or samsung for it to recognize. The front camera is also bad but I don't use that much at all so it's not a problem for me. Overall, price is great compared to other mainstream brands. Best if used as a temporary phone til your upgrade is up, as I can see the screen being annoying in the long run. I ended up returning mine as I just couldn't get used to the screen.",3,0,,
Battery damaged,"The phone is ok and i can deal with the screen some people have complained about viewing angle but this phone is actually 1.2 gig internally memory and not 4 gig. But the worst thing is the battery after several full charges only lasts two hours with the phone idle, if you are actually doing anything you can literally watch the battery meter drop like its a v8 or something, also the battery's red X's were bright red as if the battery had went for a swim. I saw one review that said they had a water damaged battery as well, perhaps if I receive a new undamaged battery that worked as it should I would update to 3 stars because the phone does run well. Have only had this phone a few days so far........",1,0,,
Parts not available,"I just acquired this phone, it being my first ever ""Blu"" purchase. I almost immediately discovered that you cannot buy an extra battery for this model phone. I contacted about 10 public cell phone accessory websites as well, to no avail. I contacted Blu Products who referred me to their preferred dealer who handles all of the accessories for Blu Products. Upon contacting them they stated they do NOT have a battery for the Blu Advance 4.0. I am currently trading emails with Blu Products (after spending over one hour listening to music when calling them direct - finally gave up and hung up) to try and find out if this situation could possibly be true. Beware - I am telling you that if you purchase this phone - and want to subsequently buy a back up and/or additional battery - my advice is to look elsewhere.",1,0,,
"Its, ok","As a phone it's ok, 3G connection is great (but will depend on you telephone company's HSDPA bands), it actually works as a wifi hotspot much faster than samsung galaxy note I, but it's user interface freezes once in a while maybe because of only 512MB RAM. Skype runs realy bad on this phone, but apart form that it realy nice for the price. Battery life is good (9/10).",3,0,,
SIM cards are stuck. Does not work with Brightspot Mobile,"I wish I could give a negative star. Where do I start: * BluProducts Customer service is never available * The manual is not very clear * It does not work with Brightspot Mobile or TMobile * Beware when you slide your SIM card, don't expect it to be returned. Although it has 2 SIM slots, don't expect it to be reliable. My SIM card got stuck. My poor friend decided to see if her SIM card worked in the other slot. Both of them are now stuck!! Unable to push it out. Design looks great, but beware of the inside * Battery smells odd We are now without a phone or SIM card",1,0,,
"I wanted to like this phone, but it was impossible.","I wanted to like this phone, but it was impossible. The screen quality was some of the worst I have ever seen. The viewing angles were laughably narrow. The camera was bad, like flip-phone bad. The dual sim card feature is great, unless you are only running one sim card. Then you get the joy of having a ""Sim card not installed"" message all the time! The dropped calls, bad audio quality, and propensity to accidentally dial numbers were just the horrible icing on the already bad cake. Needless to say, I do not recommend purchasing this device.",1,0,,
Junk Phone.,After 3 weeks the phone completely shut down. No power or without battery. Piece of crap phone has now been returned for a full refund.,1,0,,
Great Little Starter Phone,Going in I didn't have high expectations. While I did read some reviews and saw some YouTube videos I knew not to expect much being that Blu wasn't a big box brand like LG or Samsung. However when I did receive the phone and used the phone it far exceeded any expectation that I had. The call quality if excellent. It's has Hspa+ but it will only work on T-Mobile towers so if you have Att then you would be limited to 3g. The ca cacaptive screen touch if very responsive. The UI of the device is clean and user friendly. You get full access to the Google Play store. It's a good little starter android phone. For the price and the features.......you can't possibly complai about. This device even lets you make a mobile hotspot......however you can't rename the ssid or create a WPA password. So it is open and accessible to anyone around. Again it's little to complain about. I would even try one of its big brothers such as the Blu 5.5 studio. I also read that Blu is making their first LTE device and ma already be available.,3,0,,
piece of junk,"This phone is a nightmare. It's difficult to use, almost as if the buttons and controls are set incorrectly. I spent several hours trying to figure out how to reboot it (restore factory settings), and THERE IS NO WAY TO SELECT THE OPTION FOR REBOOT/ERASE, even though I finally pulled up that menu on the phone. This is the most ridiculous piece of junk I ever bought from amazon. The company (Blu Phone) has no customer service, which should tell you something. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.",1,0,,
gross,"This phone has a TERRIBLE screen. I saw the specs for it and it said TFT screen so I said ok it is a bad screen compared to my Huawei W1 which had an IPS screen but I didn't think it would be too bad since I had a Huawei Mytouch which had a TFT screen. But upon opening it I saw the worst screen I have ever layed eyes on. Even a feature phone has a better screen than this. I am not exaggerating. Viewing angles are pretty much non-existent so if you try to take a picture in the mirror for example all you will see is yourself in photo-negative form. Overall It just feels really cheap and nasty. You might say what can you expect for $80? Well that is exactly the amount that the Huawei W1 cost me and it is leagues better. If you are willing to pay a little more ($100-130) get the Nokia 635 which is much better still. At these price ranges, with Android, you are just going to find really gross phones. If you want a cheap but good phone you're going to have to go with WindowsPhone. SUSPICIOUS REVIEWS. There is a bunch of people leaving reviews for this phone with very simplistic unspecific reviews like ""excellente."" I clicked on their user profiles. And they all have only one review on their profiles- for this phone. Do not be fooled!",1,0,,
Great phone minus the horrible viewing angle,"Important! Please understand that the viewing angle on this phone is HORRIBLE! You have to angle the screen in front of you a certain way or else the image fades to black. Even if you tilt the phone down slightly, the image quality changes drastically. For this very reason, the front camera is near useless. You can't see yourself on the screen because the viewing angle is so low. You will see a darkened version of you and you'll just have to hope for the best when you take the picture. Going from a Samsung Galaxy S2 to this phone, I noticed an immediate difference in the viewing angle. Keep this in mind. With all of that being said... this is an EXCELLENT entry-level phone. The battery holds a longer charge than my GS2. You get Android version 4.2 with the phone (latest is 4.4 as of this writing) so it's not completely upgraded, but version 4.2 is good enough. I got this phone primarily because I switched from Sprint to Tmobile and effectively reduced my bill by 50%. I'm liking it a lot so far, minus the viewing angle mentioned. This phone takes GSM chips, so it works on Tmobile. One thing that I dislike is that my mobile data speed is much lower than I thought I would get according to the coverage map. I get about 1mbps down/upload but I don't think this is a problem with the phone in itself. It is capable of higher speeds, for sure. The phone's viewable screen size is smaller than the GS2's. I don't really mind. I have smaller hands, so it's more comfortable for me to hold than the GS2. Another con with this is that the processing speed is slower than I thought. I notice that there is sometimes ""lag"" when I use swipe to type messages on Facebook messenger. It might just be the app, although I haven't experienced this on my GS2. The phone comes with a battery, earphones, a screen protector, and a plastic case. This is very thoughtful of this company to include so many accessories. You get an all-encompassing package with the purchase of your phone. I think that's a great deal. Overall, love the phone minus the horrible viewing angle. If they could fix that (not sure if they have in later versions), then this phone can easily earn 4-5 stars.",3,0,,
blu advance 4.0 phone,"this phone is just the right size, not a big/large cumbersome tablet/phone. so far, I like all the features, although I cant get the video calls working, there is no manual to show you how. there are 2 things I DO NOT LIKE AT ALL, ONE, THIS PHONE IS ADVERTISED AS 4G, IT IS NOT. THE BOX SHOWS 3G. AND IT KEEP DROPPING CALLS. ALSO THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE, IS THE WORSE, YOU MUST BE PREPARED TO JUST WAIT TILL SOMEONE TALKS TO YOU.",2,0,,
What a lost opportunity... BLU Advance 4.0,"The phone worked well for two months, but two weeks ago it got stuck on start up screen. What they say about the screen is true, it's hard to see it if you're not in front of it, which is a ""security feature"" by itself. Looks of the phone are great, it seems more expensive than it is. Camera quality is below average, enough for the occasional photo in broad daylight albeit not good for night shots. Storage can be expanded as much as you want, as it uses micro SD cards and regular size SIM cards (two of them). I'm still to find a cell operator whose SIMs don't work on this phone. None of these flaws or virtues were a deal breaker, as they were pretty much what I expected. But the phone doesn't move past the BLU start up screen, rendering it useless. Fixing it might be worth more than the phone itself, and the return window is behind me, so, off to the recycling bin it goes. I am giving BLU a second chance and bought the BLU Studio 5.0, which I'll duly review in two months. Be very aware of the price point, set your expectations accordingly and you might be granted a nice surprise. For me, I didn't expect much, and didn't receive much.",1,0,,
pretty good.,"it's pretty good but it drops calls all the time!!!! doesn't matter if i am driving or if i'm just sitting in my home. 95% of the time i have to call someone back! it's very annoying!! that's my main complaint but it's also not user friendly. i give it 3 stars because it does everything i need it to, just annoying at times.",3,0,,
very good for the price,"does a great job at almost everything you'd need it for. not to impressed with the camera though and GPS guidance drops often when using other features during navigation. ordered it with a group of other items, definitely functions just as advertised, received quickly and using currently, thanks",3,0,,
rip-off warning!,this phone never worked. calls dropped everytime and texts came in randomly. sent it back by mail and never recieved my refund. rip-off warning,1,0,,
Terrible Viewing Angle and Front Camera,"I got this phone for my mom but when I first used it to test it out I was disgusted. First the viewing angle of the screen absolutely sucks. You have to look directly parallel to the screen to view anything clearly, look at an angle and it sucks. The front facing camera us terrible even in a well lighted area. Terrible phone. I switched this phone and got my mom the BLU Life Play S and she loves that phone and I have the BLU Life Pure. Those are great phones with great cameras which i recommend, this one I highly do not recommend.",1,0,,
Good Phone for the Price,"The phone's touch screen and buttons work great. Voice and sound quality is great as well. However, Camera is completely useless, and the viewing angles are way way too narrow, even indoors. Apart from that, the phone runs really smooth with no delay or lag. A great deal if you can get it around 80 bucks.",3,0,,
phone is good but battery life sucks,when I got this phone I love it but then when I started to load the apps I was disappointed with the shortness of time the battery runs out. I hope that the manufacturers can fix this problem if they do I will definitely get a next one,3,0,,
"Cheap Android Phone, can't expect much","What I Like: -Decent, Solid feel -Price -Speaker quality is okay (ear piece and loud speaker) -Wireless connections work properly -Dual SIM is a nice feature -Expandable MicroSD storage What I don't like: -If you set it down wrong it will shut down, I have no idea how or why but if I set it on my counter a certain way it will reboot, no it is not dropped or thrown on the counter, honestly have no idea why. -Slow responsiveness to touch screen(but then again you paid $90 for this..) -Claim to be getting HSPA+ or HSPA when I know for a fact that I am no; At my camp(in the middle of nowhere where no other phone gets anything other that EDGE and the occasional 3G) this phone claims to have HSPA+ and HSPA. but then will not load anything internet related, not sure what the deal is what that, Obviously not HSPA there. Conclusion: Overall its a phone, nothing very fancy but its a cheap android phone(exactly what I was looking for) there are some flaws with this device, but then again only paid $90 for it. If you want something to work like a high-end phone, then you gotta pay for a high-end phone. BIGGEST ANNOYANCE: When it turns off because you set it down wrong..",3,0,,
You get what you pay for -no service no support,"One of the worst purchases I have ever made. Of course, I am sure all the 4 and 5 star people are happy with their phone because they were lucky and got a good one. It looks like about 10 to 15% of us get the units that won't work. So you have about a 85 to 90 percent chance you get a good phone. Not a good design in my experience. There is no support from Blu. The user manual is pretty useless as well. The cell phone I got has intermittent failure with the bluetooth connection. One day it works, one day it doesn't. The WiFi connection has never worked even though the WiFi signal indicator says I am getting a strong signal. Everyone's thinking Blu is going to challenge Samsung. Well if they keep producing junk like the phone I have, I think the boys at Samsung are safe.",1,0,,
"The phone has decent specs for the price, but the limited viewing angle makes it almost impossible to use.","I have a BLU Studio 5.0 which I love, so I thought this would be great too. The specs are decent, the reviews are good, and the price is right, so I took a chance. I was very disappointed as soon as I powered the phone on. I noticed right away that unless I held the phone at the perfect angle, I couldn't see what was on the screen. I saw another reviewer mention this issue, but I had no idea it would be as bad as it is. I would honestly suggest spending a few more dollars and getting the BLU Studio 5.0 as it doesn't suffer from this issue.",2,0,,
Stay away!!! Bad batteries,Very disappointing! I bought two of these for an international trip and paid for expedited shipping only to receive two phones with defective batteries. The two batteries had their moisture (humidity) indicator pink which means that I was sent bad batteries. It's frustrating that I'm forced to leave a bad comment before even getting to try the phones. Now I have to see how good/bad they will respond in replacing these batteries. But one thing for sure is that I'll be going on my trip with no phone :( Thanks a lot BLU!!!,1,0,,
The phone does not make or receive calls,"I open the phone and I realized that it REQUIRES AN Nano to Micro/Normal SIM Card Adapter. So I went to buy one. I turned on the phone, it detected my chip but the phone couldn't make or receive any calls. I couldn't load any websites or the Google play store. I have a One Plus and I am on AT&T 4G LTE and everything works perfectly. I also tried my dad's chip on both phones. Same results, my One Plus works perfectly but not the BLU 4.0. My advice to you, read all the reviews first.",1,0,,
Its OK!,"The phone is exactly as described, the front facing camera doesn't have the best quality ever, however the back camera is pretty good. The battery life isn't the best I use all my social media and as a result I have to recharge after about 10 hours daily. its pretty good.",3,0,,
Expected more but good budget smartphone,"Blue Advance 4.0 is a solid budget phone riddled with caveats. Good news is that it has some free accessories like a tpu case and screen protector, which is nice, however the headphones includes look and probably are garbage. The dual sim feature is great for some people but not me. The real problem with the phone can be seen when you first use it, for one, the screen is terrible. Even on max brightest, the view angles are awful, and even compared to my 5 year old galaxy s, which had a super amoled panel, it is waves better then this. Other technical pet peeves are that it only has 512 mb of ram, not enough, was hoping for 1gb at least. The android skin has semblance to stock jelly bean, which is fine, but I still feels quite laggy, for example require several presses on the capacitive to register a home or back action. Other problems is that it has pretty low internal storage at only 4gbs, but is expandable with a micro sd card. Though the price is however, very compelling, and though I do recommend spend an extra $30 or so dollars on a better low end smartphone like the moto E, you can't go wrong with $90 for this blu phone.",3,0,,
Check your battery's moisture indicator if you ordered from Amazon,"This is my first ""smart phone."" I received it only a few days ago and have already had a few issues. For one, the battery arrived with water damage as indicated by the pink moisture indicator on the battery. The phone was on standby for a day and the battery was drained by morning. I dislike that you can't turn the phone on when the battery is dead and you are charging it. Also, at full volume, the call volume is very low, even on speaker. The placement of the on/off button is directly across from the volume rocker, so you end up pressing both. The phone goes to sleep (a black screen) while you are talking on the phone, so you have to press the on/off button to wake it up in order to end the call, which is annoying. I wish it had a camera button, rather than having to navigate to it on the screen. It also randomly makes a notification sound when there is no reason for it. I am sort of missing my ""dumb"" phone, which never had any issues for years until recently, which is why I switched to this phone.",3,0,,
5 star reviews are made up!,"check the 5 star reviewers for this phone ""recent reviews"". you will se hundreds of reviews posted today for this ""person"". FALSE ADVERTISING! LIES FOR REVIEWS>",1,0,,
Lots of problems,"I've had this phone 2 months and it has become a major problem. It drops calls or randomly puts them on mute. It does not stay connected to my blue tooth, so I have to reconnect almost every time. The icons move on their own and apps often open independently. I have not been able to open any MMS messages. The customer service department is slow. I have never spoken to anyone because I have been on hold for up to 30 minutes on the several times when I have called. All my correspondence has been through e-mail. Now I have to mail the phone back to them for repairs, at my expense. On the plus side, this phone does far more than the owners manual lists. It has been fun discovering all the nice things it does do. I would like a more inclusive owner's manual though because I am not as tech savvy as I would like to be. If it did not drop calls it would be a great phone. If customer service was more accessible, I might be more inclined to give it 3 stars.",2,0,,
Good Stater,"Good starter phone does the basics well, the package arrived in decent time, and condition. The phone is not thin a bit too bulky but feels good in the hand, thank you.",3,0,,
My experience with it was horrible.,"This is one of the worst experiences I have had with a cell phone. It is clunky, slow, not responsive at all, constantly lagged, took forever for apps to open and function, and has one of the worst displays I have had in a phone. The viewing angles were enough to make me cry. I have upgraded tot he BLU Studio 5.0 C HD and it is like day and night. I would not recommend this phone to anyone including people who drive slow in the far left lane, Justin Beiber, or even members of ISIS.",1,0,,
Might be the worst phone I've ever purchased. This seller uses fake reviews!!!!!,"Stay away from this Phone!!!!! I have no idea why so many people gave it a good review. My only guess would be either Blu makes their own employee's leave good reviews or 90% of the people never switched from a flip phone or something and this was their first smart phone. Where to start. Firstly the screen sucks. Unless you are looking directly at the screen with it literally at eye level you can not see it. Looking at it from any other angle than directly in front of your face holding it straight up results in a washed out terrible looking screen (think old school LCD TV's where if you were sitting to the left or right of the TV you saw a washed out dimly lit screen. Also the phone does not accept multiple finger touches, so using two fingers to zoom/unzoom the screen etc.. does not work. Secondly and most importantly the phone has only 500mb of system ram. The operating system uses a good amount of that up just running it's background services. What that means is that any apps that are bigger and more complex (facebook, teamstream, youtube, etc. run very slowly, or worse, hard lockup your phone causing you to have to remove the battery. Having low ram also means that apps do not run correctly in the background to give you alerts such as instant message apps like hangouts, facebook messenger, etc.. The only time I would get a alert from a message in hangouts was if I had the app open. The phone would immediately stop the app from running in the background when I closed it, meaning no alerts from messages, and wouldn't ring my phone when I used hangouts with my google voice number over wifi. There is no way to upgrade the ram in cell phones. If your using this phone for anything other than calling or texting, maybe checking email then do not buy it. You would be much better off (if your looking for a bargain) to get a phone like the HTC Desire 510 which is about 50 bucks at bestbuy and amazon and has a quad core processor with double the system ram at 1 gb. This phone has a dual core processor at 500mb system ram.",1,0,,

"phone, internet and GPS","UPDATE:I ended up returning this phone because after only a few days of use the reaction time of the phone slowed down to the point of it being annoying. I would not recommend this phone. I would rather save the $85 and spend it on a phone that will perform well for a longer time. This is a basic smart phone. It is good for making phone calls, using the internet and the maps app. There are also some apps that will be fine on this phone. Beyond these functions this phone will come up lacking. It has a stock keyboard that will need replacing. The swift or Google keyboards will work. Also to watch any videos I have to hold the phone tilted to the left to see the screen clearly. The screen is the old basic small size. And the speaker is terrible. So if you want a good multimedia phone get something bigger and more expensive. If you just want to make calls and use the internet and maps every now and then or are just on a budget this is the phone for you.",2,0,,
Not at all what the reviews said,"This was the worse phone I have ever had and I have had some cheap phones. It wouldn't down load pictures, it dropped EVERY call after a minute, it was not a phone it was a door stop with a battery. I sent it back and got something different.",1,0,,
Warranty expired..... then dead,"My father purchased this phone for me when the keyboard on my previous phone of nearly 5 years died. I mention this because I take care of my phones and I have not had one last less than 3 years before. This phone with its lower price and high ratings, as well as extensive reviews, seemed a good choice. Much as I hate to admit it you get what you pay for. The phone lasted a little over a month. This morning when I went to gather my various electronics from my little charging area I found that the phone had- for lack of a better descriptor- died. The phone had been in my possession just long enough to not qualify for replacement or refund. Now I'm shelling out for another phone during the Christmas season, after paying through the nose for a semester of graduate school. Granted, the stress is running high and the emotions are strong. However, the phone died. Oops take that back can't get a phone apparently. ouch.",1,0,,
"Battery life is great, but the reason for two stars is simple","Phone's fast and a definite improvement over my 6 year old Nexus One (obviously). Battery life is great, but the reason for two stars is simple. I don't like the screen. As the number one most helpful comment posted, viewing the phone from different angles distorts the display a considerable amount. But that's not all. The touchscreen is even worse than the screen's display. Playing rhythm music apps requires you to anticipate for ""lag"" and wherever you touch on the screen isn't always pinpoint accurate. I don't have fat fingers (5""6, 125lbs) so when I have difficulty texting or typing in an url, it's frustrating. After installing a screen protector from EZGuardZ, performance increased considerably but still insufficient. Basically, viewing display for the phone is distorted and the touchscreen receptivity fails to meet my standards. I'm used to the touchscreen of an iPod Touch. Edit: Phone battery has gotten worse, dying much faster now.",2,0,,
but a loud buzzing on the line renders it basically useless as a phone,"I got this as a gift, and it had issues right out of the box. I can forgive having to switch carriers to use it, but a loud buzzing on the line renders it basically useless as a phone. When I tried to have it replaced, the company told me to perform a hard reset (for an apparent hardware issue, no less) and gave me a number to call if that didn't work... a number to call for the phone that can't make clear calls. It's obvious to me that no one even read my report. At this point I'll probably just have it returned and find a more reliable manufacturer. From the research I did before I got it, I think it would be a fantastic phone if it worked. However, if you happen to get one that doesn't (or if something happens to it later), then in my experience you're SOL. Take that under advisement before buying this phone.",1,0,,

"Decent phone, terrible company. My advice: avoid it or insure your phone.","I have used Blu phones (this model and other ones) for several years, and so has my family. I've recommended their phones to others. But no more. It's over Blu, and I'm really sad about it! Previous to this summer, I really liked what Blu did - make unlocked phones of good quality for this price range, expandable and customizable, many device options, US-based company, real US-based Customer Service. While the phones aren't terribly sturdy, I didn't pay for sturdy at this price, and the other aspects of the phone are respectable, especially for people who don't need (or want) to pay for high-end brand names or who are just entering the Smartphone world. My previous review of this phone on another site praised it for being a very good, inexpensive smart-phone option. It's pretty user-friendly, is expandable with it's SD slot, has 2 SIM slots (great for a business line!), comes with lots of accessories for free, has good reception, speeds, and customizability. It was sturdier, smarter, and nicer than I thought it would be at this price. I really liked it. When I dropped and broke my first one after over a year using it, I immediately bought another! However, the most recent one I got was defective, and my experience with the company has been HORRENDOUS! I have spent over a month on this with no resolution. I initiated my case online and waited for weeks with no contact. I finally got sent a replacement - a dirty, obviously used replacement with a different IMEI that was missing the backplate! I called, they said they were sorry and they'd resolve it... and then the case file was deleted after my call. But they sent me several more emails asking me to contact them and tell them ""what's wrong with the device"". My second call I was told that this was an acceptable replacement and there was no other avenue to contact them or escalate the claim. I even called their corporate office and the receptionist hung up on me after telling me she can't tell me anything! I called back later and the recording said that phone line was no longer in service! Yikes! I was shocked that any professional company would go to such lengths to avoid customers! Sad day, I used to really like them. It's like a bad breakup. I have filed a complaint with the BBB. However, I see that Blu no longer responds to customers in Amazon reviews these days (they used to sometimes) and most of their cases are not satisfactorily resolved through the BBB, so I really have no hope that they care about customers any more. I'm feeling VERY grateful that I insured the phone through Amazon, who in the past has been amazing about servicing their claims. I will be taking that route after posting this review. I'm sad that this is likely to be the end of the road between me and Blu. They used to be such a quality company, and I'm genuinely sad to see a US company that provided a much-needed unlocked smartphone option go downhill like this. =(",2,0,,

I found out the internet connection, or processor, was poor so Facebook and most apps didn't run well. I am with TMobile, but it didn't work well on Wi-Fi either which is ATT at home. I also found out that the front facing camera was very poor, so the selfies were out all together.

We tried to send calls that worked, but no matter how much I called her phone from different numbers and no matter how much coverage it showed that she had she still wasn't able to receive my phone calls!

Wish it was better than it is,"This is a frustrating purchase. Other reviewers are a little too forgiving of this phone's shortcomings due to the low cost I think.

After repositioning numerous times and booting to no avail, I pulled the sim and put it back into my old phone, confirming it works and fortunately was not scratched to the point of disrepair. Instructions for sim placement is also vague and poorly written. Ultimately thankful my sim wasn't broken and processed the return for this phone on the same day I received it.",1,0,,

Moderate so far,"I just received the white version of the phone (January, 2014; it took a few days from the Florida location to get across the country). Here are some pluses and minuses that I have experienced so far: Pluses: + =================== For my purposes, I needed a phone that would both work with Wind Mobile (1700 band) and also T-Mobile, ATT, Simple mobile, etc. While it feels and looks cheap (I wish I could find another case for it to correct that), it is reasonably fast. Also, it was really easy to root with 'framroot 1.81'. Price point: for under $100 what can you say, it gets the job done as a travel phone if you need it. IMHO (Wow! This is the first time using a hispter acronym, I embarrassed), I'd say you're better off with an unlocked Iphone 4 (craigslist $100 +) for traveling with Apple's build quality, unless again, you have a particular good reason (i.e. band) to get this. The packaging is nice enough -- comes with charger, ear buds, silicone extra case and screen protector, which I have yet to apply). Minuses: -s ==================== Compared to my daily cheap phone (a Motorolla Defy XT557) which is really quite solid, this is a much, much cheaper build. This (China) Blu is like my B1000 China phone that I previously used. Similar to the B1000, the touch screen is so-so responsive, good enough, but not up to the big brand minimum standards of both touch and build. Thus, if you had a phone like the B1000, this is not worth the upgrade unless you have a reason like I did (1700 band). Neutral: * ======================= The back half doesn't look as cheap as the front.I kind of like it The newer system (Android 4.2.2) doesn't feel as 'mentally' quick as my Defy XT. There is something about the spacing, coloring of the system access that seems off a bit. That's a really minor quibble by the way, and pretty subjective at that. Software used: ==================== 1) I use Launcher Pro Plus (an antiquated but really, really quick launcher). I can't report yet on the voice quality, but the web browsing has been reasonable enough. 2) I played with Talkatone for free wifi voip calls (and that's good until May, 2014 given the xmpp stuff that is being discontinued from google) and that worked pretty good over WiFi. 3) I use Link2SD (after the one click root method described above) and now there's much more of the 1GB internal memory left. Other tid bits: ==================== The price is a bit funky; all the press releases advertise if for $89 but I ended up paying $94.99 with shipping (which I suppose is alright). I've also seen it going for about $10 more than I paid. I say funky because I would have loved it if the big brand stores and sites (Amazon, Best Buy, etc.) matched the scores of PR releases about the phone and then gotten free shipping. Atlas, not the case. Also, I might have bought the next one up (the Studio 5 which is pr'd for $139 but sells for a fair amount higher than that). I'll update once I actually use it as a phone. :)",3,0,,

Top of the Trash Heap,"You know what you are getting into with a phone at this price. My old phone broke after receiving water damage, and I was forced to switch to this phone in a hurry. Pros: 1. The price - This is one of the cheapest smartphones that money can buy, while still maintaining functionality in most features 2. The guts - This phone contains little seen features in American phones such as 2 SIM Card slots and a removable battery. On a user side, the phone has an FM radio scanner that works with any headset, and has the ability to automatically turn on and off at user set times. Cons: 1. The screen - This screen looks right out of 1999, and not in a good way. This is a pretty minor point, as it is easy to get used to after a few minutes of distortion. 2. Storage space - I constantly run into situations where I cannot install apps due to ""insufficient storage"" even though I have 14 GB left on my micro-SD card. I am probably missing something, but they do not make it clear what the issue is. 3. No data connection (might be unique to AT&T) - I cannot access the internet in any form when outside of Wi-Fi connection. No idea how to fix this, but it definitely puts a bummer on my day at some points. Not a huge issue, since most places have Wi-Fi, but it is scary being out with no way to access Maps or ride services.",2,0,,

Company needs more experience / more time. You do get what you pay for.,"I was very excited to find this company and their line of products. The bang for the buck is there on the surface. The challenge is in execution. This phone worked very well for the first month. After that some bugs started creeping in. First it wouldn't charge completely when plugged into the charger, then it started freezing up. Now we constantly struggle with it turning on/off randomly. The only remedy sometimes is to pull the battery and start over. Lastly, BLU customer service is very unprofessional and amateur. Even the automated phone system when you call in has bugs and glitches out. I contacted them about the warranty replacement and it took 3 separate phone calls and 2 emails back and forth to finally receive an RMA approval. Now they require a 20 day turnaround to ship the phone (at my cost), assess the claim, and return the phone. They offer no advance warranty replacement and offered only excuses when I asked for an expedited process. I am torn between liking on paper the products they offer at competitive prices but disliking the support in the end. I guess the age old adage of ""You get what you pay for"" holds true here as well.",3,0,,
Don't buy this phone if you want to surf web or use cell data,"very disappointing phone. I've now taken it to Spain for use and to the UK. The phone is simply a crummy product. I've went through 2 different SIMs in Madrid -- the data coverage and throughput was awful. I went to the first provider and attempted to troubleshoot my data throughput problems -- and the shop stated it was the phone not the SIM (they put the SIM in another phone and had no problems). I purchased another SIM from another provider (O2) and once again, had the same problems. I'm now in the UK and I thought I'd give the phone another try -- picked up a T-mobile-UK sim an once again, can't get any data to work. It runs android 4.2. It seems pretty obvious that the phone CPU is underpowered for this implementation. The screen is low quality -- washed out and very difficult to see when outside. Put simply, don't buy this phone. While it was only about $50 -- I would have spent more to have a functional phone. I'm a bit shocked that the manufacturer released a phone that's underpowered and it's ability to handle 3g data is a joke -- it crawls (despite the ads, it doesn't support 4g here in europe either )",1,0,,

This phone has recently decided to stop connecting to my home WiFi although the password is correct. On to texting... The touchscreen has some kind of delay and the calibration is slightly off. It also has a small vibration after every letter you press and this setting cannot be changed , or at least not easily. I'm a normal sized girl with small hands I should have no issues but I constantly have to be correcting errors while texting because the phone enters the wrong letters. That's my experience with this phone.",3,0,,
Not happy at all,"it was fine for 6 months, now it's all screwed up and I do not have time to spend HOURS AND HOURS on Google trying to figure out how to fix this phone. So I'm not too happy. WTF is the point of a ""smart""phone when everything is a chore to use and all you can do is make calls and send texts?!?! I may as well have bought a cheap phone with only those 2 capabilities. $80 for what. For what exactly. Problems? Where to begin...: -Says storage space is running low. It's not. At all. I have plenty of space, and an 8 GB SD card with 5GB free. -Because of this, the phone's capabilities seem drastically reduced. There's a lot it won't do now just because of this BS storage issue. -Stopped syncing correctly -I cannot send emails(Gmail) -It's overall slow, freezes, jerky All this persists after I have done what I could to maintain it, clean it, keep it up to date. I've used the ""All-in-One toolbox"" app to manage things. Cleared the cache. Why do I have in my hand a SMARTphone that requires so much maintenance. Not worth the trouble.",1,0,,
Zero for Two,"The Advance 4.0 is an excellent Android platform for browsing, messaging, email, Google Maps, and many other tasks. Call clarity is excellent while it lasts. It is a lousy phone. The sensor that tells the phone it is against your face and that it should not display the ""End Call"" button is apparently out to lunch. On many occasions multiple users of the phone experienced premature hang-up. The screen could be seen alternately blanking and reappearing while against the user's face. A touch of the cheek to the button ended the calls. I figured a phone that has so many positive reviews must suffer an occasional crib death, and another one would work as advertised. After a speedy and smooth Amazon exchange the BLU proved the exception to the rule. #2 happily hung up on customers and a check with AT&T confirmed that the phone was sending the hang-up signal. Second phone returned. Two stars because of Amazon's excellent product return and the hope that there are a few Advance 4.0s out there providing faithful service.",2,0,,
THUMBS DOWN,"(Original review) I don't use a cell phone often, but needed something that I can use for both domestic and foreign travel. Any lack of iPhone-like features this phone might have is of no consequence to me whatsoever. I just have an occasional need to make a phone call - nothing more - so for me this is about as tricked out as a phone ever needs to be - possibly more. That said, the big stink I read in some reviews here about poor screen quality seems exaggerated, and this claim truly stumps me. I have no problem making out what's on the display. I do notice that if the phone is pivoted up or down (less so from side to side), that the display fades out a bit. Seriously, is it that hard to hold the phone in its optimum viewing position? I am more than pleased with all the features of this cell phone - the most important for me are the GSM, dual Sims, unlocked features. Being able to buy a cheap no-contract-pay-as-you go wireless service here or abroad - on just one cell phone - is priceless. ? ? ? UPDATE / January 2015 I'll stand by my first review, but downgrade my star rating because the phone was a goner in just three months. I sent it back for warranty repair/replacement - they require signature confirmation on warranty returns which cost me $13. They sent me a new phone AND IT WAS DOA - IT TOO DOESN'T WORK. That's it for me - I'm not jumping through that hoop again.",1,0,,
Parts not available,"I just acquired this phone, it being my first ever ""Blu"" purchase. I almost immediately discovered that you cannot buy an extra battery for this model phone.

Upon contacting them they stated they do NOT have a battery for the Blu Advance 4.0. I am currently trading emails with Blu Products (after spending over one hour listening to music when calling them direct - finally gave up and hung up) to try and find out if this situation could possibly be true. Beware - I am telling you that if you purchase this phone - and want to subsequently buy a back up and/or additional battery - my advice is to look elsewhere.",1,0,,

Blu phone battery not up to standard.,"The phone seems pretty good for the price, many nice features, .BUT!!!!!!, the Company, Blu, basically showed no interest or concern to my information to them that the battery in the Blu showed water damage to the battery in that it, the batteries water damage indicator showed red x's and the battery SEEMED to be loosing charge at an unacceptable rate in spite of establishing all safeguards possible to lessen battery loss. They responded to my information about the battery by saying ""you will have to contact the point of sale person (Amazon), or buy a new battery."" I would NOT recommend their product because of the battery problem. I find Blu's refusal to replace the battery unacceptable.

"Decent phone for the price, but has its drawbacks.","The phone is a decent phone for the price. However, it does have its drawbacks. The touchscreen is not very responsive - I don't know if it is because of the screen protected (that came with the phone), but sometimes I have to press multiple times before touches are recognized, particularly on the bottom right of the screen where the ""back button"" is located on most screens. I was expecting the phone to be a bit faster - it takes a noticeable amount of time before apps load. The volume is not very high either, so it can be hard to hear clearly in a noisy environment. Perhaps my biggest complaint is that this comes with the older Android OS (4.2.2) and it doesn't seem like this is going to get an upgrade. And since this doesn't seem to be popular with the developer community, you are unlikely to get custom ROMs for this phone. I like that it came with a protective silicone case and a screen protector.",3,0,,

In order to press an on-screen button, I have to press it multiple times, sometimes mashing my entire finger on the screen in the hopes that it'll detect. An additional problem I have with this phone is the quality of the camera. I enjoy using my phone to remotely deposit bank checks and take up-close photos of documents. However, this phone is unable to do either. It is unable to focus on very close objects, and the resulting images are extremely blurry. I would not recommend this phone for someone who takes up close photographs.",1,0,,
"Cheap glitchy phone, perhaps disposable for some","This is definitely not a 4 star phone. Lots of little technical problems add up to make it a pretty mediocre product. The touch screen is not very sensitive and the processing time is pretty slow and very glitchy. I find that I often have to restart the phone. I bought it because I mostly just use google maps, gmail and texting. All other apps I've tried to use on here are pretty slow to function. The camera doesn't switch or activate properly for use in photo apps and pictures come out grainy. I also bought it because I've destroyed a lot of previous phones and I've dropped this one quite a few times now and it's held up nicely. Compared to previous phones I've had around the same price point (LG optimus, Google phones) I would not pick this one. The older LG's and G phones operate better and faster than this newer BLU phone but they are more delicate compared to the BLU (screen cracking, case chipping etc)",2,0,,

Nope.,"DO NOT buy BLU products. Yes, they're cheap, but you get what you pay for. About a week ago, my phone decided to freak out and have all apps and system functions ""unfortunately stop"". So I restarted the phone. It froze on start-up, so after removing the battery I restored it to factory settings. After about three hours, any app I tried to open would stop. So I rebooted it. It froze again, and this time took three removals of the battery before it started up again. For the last few days, this happens at least twice a day, and it takes more and more removals of the battery before it starts. I just spent a good ten minutes removing the battery (at least thirty times) to no avail, so I'm putting the SIM card back into my old phone that's horribly cracked and still works better than this piece of sh*t.

"Decent, save for the hard-to-see screen","For the price, this phone isn't that bad, but I had to return mine for one issue - the screen isn't visible outside even in shade or in the car. That's a problem. One expects a budget handset to skimp on the screen. However, even if otherwise fully functional, what good does it do if you can't see it? If you'll only ever use it in lower light settings, here's what you'll get: A fully functional android phone without bloatware with a decent battery and is responsive to simple tasks, but inadequate for gaming and the like. The screen is visible only straight on. Call quality is okay. Camera is below average. Storage is expandable via microsd card.

It's real swell,"This phone was small but surprisingly durable for a long time. It comes with a small case that protected the sides and the screen only broke once I dropped on asphalt without it's case on. My only problem was that the battery started swelling up and I could no longer even put the back on the phone. Upon reading up on it, this could be very dangerous and even by replacing the battery it could potentially happen again and catch fire. The phone began to get really hot while it was charging. After some time the battery wouldn't even fit in the phone and I was forced to replace it. The phone itself lasted about nine months for me, which was actually a significant amount since I always seem to break them early. For the price it's definitely a deal, but the swelling battery was a huge turn off and I'd rather my pocket didn't catch fire, even for a hundred dollars less.",3,0,,
Crappiest keyboard ever.,"I rally debated the number of stars for this. I mean, it's a fairly cheap phone, so one should expect it to be less than perfect. I bought this to replace a Nokia, which I didn't like because it kept shutting down on me and because it was a Microsoft platform and, I mean, really? I wanted an Android and I couldn't see spending hundreds of dollars. It's an okay phone that I'd probably give 3 or 4 stars for if it weren't for the keyboard. It is total, utter crap. I'm constantly mistyping and hitting that stupid emoticon button on the bottom right. You kind of have to hit the keys slightly off center in order to MAYBE type what you want. The voice dictation works very well, but often you aren't somewhere where you (or at least I) want others to hear my messages. On the plus side, it's cheap and it charges very quickly.",2,0,,

"Doesn't Suit My Needs, I Expected Too Much","If you're like me, and use your phone for tons of things, this isn't the phone for you. Usable storage space is 1.3 GB. And you get maybe half of that after all the built-in apps. I've downloaded seven apps, apps that I consider necessities, and I can't update any of them, because even though there's still 200 MB of storage left, the phone feels there isn't enough space to update them. It's also a bit slow, but that's to be expected with the price. I know that you get what you pay for, and in this case, I didn't pay for enough. If you need a budget phone, and don't rely on it too much, go ahead and order it, it should fit your needs perfectly. If you like having games and apps to get things done, move on and find something else.",3,0,,

based on the other very good reviews. You get what you paid for,"I bought two of it, one for myself, the other for my dad, based on the other very good reviews. You get what you paid for...actually I could and would have got a much better one with a little bit more money if I have time to try it first. This phone is at least 3-4 years outdated. The screen is terrible. I can't see anything under sun or at an angle. One of the two batteries lasts less than a day with almost no use. Somehow I can't connect it to computer to upload the pictures. And it starts giving this loud ring when nothing comes up in the middle of night--still need to figure out how to turn the sound off, which isn't too obvious. Good thing about it...it is indeed unlocked, and it can display many languages.",2,0,,
'Unlocked' does not mean entirely usable....,"Well.... I wanted to like the phone; my first Android. I bought it after research here on Amazon to use on a 6 month transfer to the UK. Confirmed that it is unlocked... just like the name says. UI and layout are good, and I loaded p the SIM card with a bunch of useful apps from my home wireless. When I got to the UK and popped in a major name SIM chip, the warm and fuzzy started to wear off... As it turns out there is 'Unlocked' and then truly unlocked. I cannot get a cellular data connection here in the UK with numerous SIM chips and trips to the major mobile phone shops (Voda, O2....) Wireless connections are no problem, ; cell phone and text are OK, thus the 3 stars. So it is half a doorstop while I am here.",2,0,,

On the second occasion, while using whatsapp it just froze and the newly received message could not be opened. However, earlier today, I became aware that Google Play Store just would not load. I keep getting a message saying ""error retrieving information from server [ DF-DFERH-01]"" I am beginning to feel this phone was rushed through production/assembly and is mediocre quality.

Miscellaneous other bugs (such as cannot send SMS from the secondary SIM) completes the feature list. On the PROs, the dual SIM is helpful for those who wear two hats (like me) and do not want to carry two phones. Application software upgrade also works, although I could not get the system software to upgrade. However, I'm sure there are better dual SIM Android phones out there; don't waste your money on this as it is all but unusable.",2,0,,
Crushing hopes,"Saw all the reviews, was so excited. Bought as temporary, but it was performing so well, I started thinking I could use it for as long as it worked. Worked fine for a few weeks, and I was still really happy with it, and then it began to freeze and refused to react to powering off unless I manually took the battery out, and then it'd restart over and over until it ran out of battery. Phones in today's world can be someone's whole life, and while I really only needed it for calls and messages, it got to a point where I couldn't even do those things. I can't believe the amount of problems it started to show-- it literally went from 100 to 0 functionality in less than a month.",1,0,,
Not the best,"I ended up returning this phone because i disliked it so much. Amazon issued me a full refund minus the cost of shipping. At first it seemed like a decent phone for the price, but there were 3 issues that just drove me crazy after about a week of use: 1) The screen has a very limited viewing angle. If you tilt it even slightly, you can't see what's on the screen anymore. 2) The camera is of poor quality. Even with the flash on and at the highest resolution setting, pictures were grainy and often out of focus. 3) The screen freezes and distorts when using simple apps (Facebook messenger, for instance, almost always locked up when i would use it).",2,0,,

Screen is hard to view from any angle more than like 20 degrees off facing the screen directly. Touch screen is older type, not very sensitive. Would not recommend this phone, although a friend has a more expensive BLU model phone and seems to like it. Just steer clear of this phone unless you have no other choice.",2,0,,

"A game player, recorder, camera - just get a good SD Card to go with it.","I admittedly don't use this as a phone, or a text sender. I use it to play games. And for that purpose, this is generally a good phone for the price. It plays games pretty well - especially those that don't require bloatware like Google Play or Amazon.Mind you, I can't give it good marks because I bought and added a 16 GB SD Card, and that has probably alleviated a lot of the issues others complain about. More space = faster phone. It is decent at recording film and taking pictures. Don't take closeup shots with it - it only has the quality of a mid-90s camcorder.

Totally Defective,The first unit I ordered was defective as the calls were getting cut off within 2-3 seconds When I called BLU customer service they requested me to do a HARD RESET and sent the instructions to do so and walked me through it Still didn't work -I returned this unit and asked for a replacement SAME PROBLEM Am returning it also I saw that there were about 75 bad reviews on this model However I purchased the BLU 4.5 NEO and that works perfectly I think you should stop selling the 4.0 as there is obviously a problem with that model Philip Jayawardena,1,0,,
Just no.,"I can't even express how much I dislike this phone. The keyboard is difficult to type on, the screen is overly sensitive when scrolling on the internet, the apps available are minimal, the inherent browser is annoying (only 6ish windows are allowed and it closes old ones randomly, when you hit back if you're on the first page, it will close the window, there is no forward button), the inherent mail option only allows one mailbox, so you have to have multiple mail icons to manage different mailboxes, etc. All in all I found it non-intuitive and usually frustrating.

UPDATED REVIEW,"***UPDATE*** So, I loved this phone when I first got it. It seemed fairly easy to use and I learned more and more about it each day for awhile. Then, just over 90 days in, AFTER the warranty expired, it started acting up. It would turn itself off, it would lock up, it wouldn't send text, it wouldn't load the internet. I had to reboot it many times because the screen would lock up, I couldn't make calls, or it wasn't receiving text messages- even ones that my husband sent me from his phone, sitting next to me, on the same carrier and plan as me (family account). Then, on March 5, 2015, it completed stopped working. System UI stopped, Bluetooth stopped. This phone had an almost perfect screen, a few smudge scratches, but regular 'wear and tear' you could expect from someone who uses it mainly as a safety device. (so my disabled parent would be able to reach me at ANY time) It was in my pocket maybe 2 hours a day, the remainder of each day it was on a desk/nightstand. March 6, 2015, we took it to an AT&T store hoping that they could at least transfer the data on it to a new phone, BUT it would no longer even boot up. I thought maybe I needed to fully charge it, remove the battery, etc- but no- it just completely crashed, it would flicker a light on, then turn right off, ONCE, then did nothing. It completely died- not even one year after purchase. And My husband's Nokia Lumia 520, which I bought the same day, hasn't had even one problem. The man at the AT&T store asked what kind of phone it was before I had handed it to him, and as soon as I said Blu, I got an 'oh, one of those'. Even they know the brand, not for its 'greatness'. So, feel free to waste your money like I did, thinking you would get a steal, or for 50$ you can get a Windows Phone, Nokia Lumia that actually works. _______________________________________________ My first ""smarter than user"" phone and liking it so far... Only wish it came with more thorough operating instructions as I am very new to the smart phone world and it is kicking my butt so far! Easy to operate the majority of the functions and comes with the nice Google play store so you can easily download many apps, etc. Great choice for a first timer or experienced smart phone user. Does NOT come with a sim card and has the option of using two at once- be sure to get a sim card ahead of time as this phone has a larger one then in comparable sized phones like the Nokia Lumia's.",1,0,,
A Major Disappointment,"I ordered this item in November 2014. The features are great and it worked well with the dual sims - at first. By February 2015, the handset begins to freeze up and won't move beyond the boot screen - even after I removed the sim cards as well as the memory card. I bought this handset for my daughter for her birthday and she barely had 3 months use of it. I have since tried to return it for an exchange but is unable to do so because it is now out of the returns window.

Not worth it; freezes up. Second Blu phone we've been through.,Bought this for Christmas last year for my wife; It didn't make it 5 months before it started freezing up. This is the second Blu phone we've been through that didn't last more than 5 months. It's not worth the money; the phones were never dropped or damaged in any way. They both froze constantly to where you had to remove the battery completely to get it work again. It couldn't handle many apps; it would automatically get hot and go back to the home screen.

Somehow, It hangs up on people often. The processor is slow. There is little memory. And occasionally, the screen just doesn't show anything even though the phone is on (can't even just turn it off ndo on then--have to take the battery out to get it to work right again).

Great phone if you don't want to talk to anyone for more than 45 seconds.,"Bought this for my daughter. It was buggy from the start. It has nice design, good screen and two sim slots, but you couldn't hold a conversation of longer than 45 seconds without the call dropping. Maybe we got a lemon, but it really deserves O stars because it was not fit for the intended purpose. Returned it and got a Samsung for cheap at Fry's and it has worked great.",1,0,,
Not a happy camper.,"Not a happy camper..I brought this phone for my mom I thought I was getting a good deal with this purchase since the product arrived on time and in good condition.

Now I have to get a replacement, Hope this one will work better.",2,0,,

We are really disappointed.,I bought 2 phones. It seems to be almost impossible to send pictures through text.

I wish we would have spent the money and bought different phones. We are really disappointed.,2,0,,
IT DON'T WORK NOHOW.,Put in my AT&T SIM. It saw the SIM and I thought that it would work but it refuses to see the network for voice call. Nothing will change it's little mind on this. It's useless. I finally became mad enough to slam it against the brick fence in my backyard (after removing the SIM). I'll stick with my old Motorola clam shell from now on. No sissy smart phones for me.,1,0,,
Freezes up and Blu customer service is terrible.,I bought this phone for my husband. It is terrible. It freezes up all of the time. The customer service for Blu is awful.

Broken Hearted Texan,I wanted this to work. I was impressed with a U.S. company was making a budget phone and really wanted it to work so very much. But we had so many issues with the phone.

Not good.,"It's good for a cheap replacement, but other than that it's horrible. It force quits on everything. This phone can't handle much at all.

"The Samsung works great, has all the same features","You get what you pay for! The blue tooth would not sync up with my 2013 Hyundai Sonata. None of my other phones had this problem. The display had to be viewed at just the right angle, especially when watching videos; otherwise it would appear too dark to see any detail. Also, after setting up the mobile network by creating a new APN, it kept changing back to the default APN, which is not even associated with my wireless carrier. I had to manually change it back to the new APN whenever I wanted to get internet or use apps. There was no way to delete the original APN's that were installed. I returned it and got the Samsung Galaxy S Duos II S7582 White DUAL SIM Factory Unlocked International Ver for about $40 more. If you do a comparison, you will see that these two phones are very similar. The Samsung works great(none of the above problems), has all the same features, and I am very happy with it.",2,0,,
traveler,Nice phone. Can do without the humming sound.,3,0,,
Not worth it.,"Do yourself a huge favor and spend a little more to get the Moto G. It is so much better in so many ways. First the Moto G has a MUCH better screen. The Advance 4.0 has a screen that only looks decent if you look at it straight on. If you tilt the phone the image will wash away. You will not want to browse the web or do anything that involves using the screen often because you will hate to look at it. Second, the speakerphone works only so so. You will not want to use it because the sound is so muffled and low. Third, because the screen is so cheap it attracts fingerprints like crazy so you will be cleaning it very often. And finally, the battery life on this phone is horrible. I turned off Wi-Fi, disabled all services and email, turned off blue tooth, disabled 3G and even installed the Battery Doctor App and put my phone to sleep at 100% charge. After 2 days of doing nothing but sleeping the phone was down to only 18%! That is atrocious considering they say the phone should last far longer in idle mode. Finally, there are no plans to ever update this phone to KitKat. The CEO of BLU basically said that if you want a more advanced OS then go and get a better phone. When I emailed BLU they just gave me a canned response. It appears that BLU is more concerned about releasing new phones (They have like 36 different phones!) rather than supporting and updating the phones that people already use. Spend a little more and get the Moto G or even the Moto E and you will be soooo much happier. And both the Moto G and the Moto E come with the latest version of KitKat out of the box!",2,0,,

Phone Faulty,"This phone is the right size and has the features that I need without the fluff. Unfortunately, I cannot access the Internet except through Wi-Fi. I even took the phone to my service provider, who verified all settings to ensure the 3G was enabled. It was. So, they thought maybe the sim card was the problem since it was transferred straight from my old device into this phone. Nope, even a new card didn't make a difference, and a second technician verified the settings. And then on top of that, the lower ""buttons"" (Menu, Home, & Return) starting flashing intermittently today for no reason. My service provider believes the phone is faulty. I still need to contact the company and seller, so hopefully an exchange goes quickly and smoothly.",1,0,,

"A good burner phone; otherwise, pay a little more for something better","I bought this for someone who lost two phones in six months thinking that it wouldn't hurt the wallet so much if this trend continues. The phone basically does work: makes and receives calls and texts. The screen is sufficiently bright when looked at directly, but off-axis viewing is bad. Consider it a ""privacy"" feature, making it hard for anyone sitting next to you to peek at your screen. I found the touchscreen disappointing. The screen feels spongy - it deforms easily when touched, but more importantly, often times it takes an extra touch to get the screen to respond. Otherwise, the UI never lagged and the few apps that I tried didn't stutter. I knew it would have a stock Android build (Jellybean 4.1.2) with no or minimal improvements by BLU. Based on screenshots, it looks like the Cyanogenmod 10.2 (open-source Android OS) that I run on my Galaxy S2, and so I assumed that it would have all the features, configurability, bells, and whistles that I have. Unfortunately, it didn't. It didn't come with Cyanogenmod's powerful cLock widget or a keyboard that support gestures (think: Swype), though both could be downloaded from Google Play as the Chronos and Google Keyboard apps, respectively. It also came with very few options to customize the look feel - changing the number of icons displayed, removing the Google search bar, lock screen widgets, etc. Stock Android is not very pretty to look at so I had hoped to make the phone's interface more useful and less annoying. I returned the phone and purchased an LG Optimus F3 for $50 more. For the money, I got a better display, a better-feeling touchscreen, a much larger battery, and true 4G LTE support. (BLU's ""4G"" is based on those who say anything over 10Mbps is ""4G"", which IMO is fast enough to be usable. Others snicker and call that ""faux-G"".) LG also customized their Android appearance so it is more visually appealing and in some minor ways, changed buttons or moved things around to make the user experience less confusing.",2,0,,

Waste of Time and Money,"After reading other reviews I had what I believed were reasonable hopes for the phone. I received the phone only to learn that I had to purchase a SIM card for the phone. Unfortunately due to where I live I had to purchase the SIM card online. For some reason FedEx required a signature on a $0.99 SIM card. By the time I finally got the SIM card and activated service on the new phone I was 2 weeks into the return period (you are only allowed 30 days). First, the reviewers that are critical about the glare on the screen. They are ABSOLUTELY correct. I didn't think it would be such a big deal for me but I can't hardly use my phone outside for anything. Both cameras are low quality. I can't get cell service to make calls or send or receive text messages. I do work in a building where it is notoriously difficult to get a reliable cell signal but ... I will be switching back to my old phone that would at least tell me if someone tried to call. With my old phone I could actually send texts as well. I tried to give the phone a fair shake and not make a rash judgement. As a result I missed the return window and I am stuck with a sub par product.",1,0,,

Not a good IPhone replacement - picture or feel..,"I was eager with the reviews that I read. It did not meet my expectation. I am coming from an IPhone and it promised so much that I was tragically crushed to find out that it was not even close to something that I could use for four things - text, talk, pictures and recording. The phone was an award hold which did not lend itself to for texting. Nor did the screen - the phone had to be tilted to be able to see the picture or screen. Which make it terrible for picture taking. Extremely disappointed. Such high hopes crushed. I am presently dealing with a Windows phone. We will see what comes about that...oh yes it was impossible or nearly impossible to put the SIM card in. I did not want to break it. The first smart phone that I had to deal with that was like that.

Gave it the old college try...,"Hello, and good day. I am currently rating this product at 3 stars, until I get my replacement unit. When I received my first model from rush direct, and was examining the phone, I noticed it refused to pick up the sim card from sim slot 1. I checked this with some other sim cards I had on hand, and ran some hardware tests via android apps. No matter what i tried, sim card reader 1 would just not work. Other than this hiccup, the phone seemed quite sturdy, everything else except the sim card 1 worked perfectly, I will update my score when i get my replacement unit, and do a full review then. Just keep in mind that Blu is a new company, so there are prone to be bugs and quality control issues as with any new startup business. I will say the experience I had with one of their other products, the BLU Dash 5.0, was very solid (if a bit too big for my uses), so hopefully the replacement unit will be as solid as that device. UPDATE: I have received the replacement unit, and unfortunately, it was just as defective as the first. I have found the radio to be defective in the replacement. Besides dropping calls left and right, it also would drain the battery extremely quickly, indicating a short of some kind in the cellular radio. I did try and pop it into the second sim card slot, and while this did solve the rapid battery drainage problem nicely, it also started to short, and began to drop calls as well. I'm guessing this particular model has a manufacturing defect in the radio or sim card reader. For those who are wondering why the battery doesn't last as long, this might have something to do with this. Overall, I can't, in good faith, recommend this product. I instead returned this, and purchased a more expensive, but still excellent for the price THL W200S, which so far has exceeded my expectations. Be warned, for the price you /could/ get a good phone, but quality control appears to be nonexistant, so buyer beware.",2,0,,

The date on the Wallpaper was in Euro time zone. I tried diligently to change it and then called customer support. They told me how to reset the phone and THAT didn't even work.

"A good burner phone; otherwise, pay a little more for something better","I bought this for someone who lost two phones in six months thinking that it wouldn't hurt the wallet so much if this trend continues. The phone basically does work: makes and receives calls and texts. The screen is sufficiently bright when looked at directly, but off-axis viewing is bad. Consider it a ""privacy"" feature, making it hard for anyone sitting next to you to peek at your screen. I found the touchscreen disappointing. The screen feels spongy - it deforms easily when touched, but more importantly, often times it takes an extra touch to get the screen to respond. Otherwise, the UI never lagged and the few apps that I tried didn't stutter. I knew it would have a stock Android build (Jellybean 4.1.2) with no or minimal improvements by BLU. Based on screenshots, it looks like the Cyanogenmod 10.2 (open-source Android OS) that I run on my Galaxy S2, and so I assumed that it would have all the features, configurability, bells, and whistles that I have. Unfortunately, it didn't. It didn't come with Cyanogenmod's powerful cLock widget or a keyboard that support gestures (think: Swype), though both could be downloaded from Google Play as the Chronos and Google Keyboard apps, respectively. It also came with very few options to customize the look feel - changing the number of icons displayed, removing the Google search bar, lock screen widgets, etc. Stock Android is not very pretty to look at so I had hoped to make the phone's interface more useful and less annoying. I returned the phone and purchased an LG Optimus F3 for $50 more. For the money, I got a better display, a better-feeling touchscreen, a much larger battery, and true 4G LTE support. (BLU's ""4G"" is based on those who say anything over 10Mbps is ""4G"", which IMO is fast enough to be usable. Others snicker and call that ""faux-G"".) LG also customized their Android appearance so it is more visually appealing and in some minor ways, changed buttons or moved things around to make the user experience less confusing.",2,0,,

Waste of Time and Money,"After reading other reviews I had what I believed were reasonable hopes for the phone. I received the phone only to learn that I had to purchase a SIM card for the phone. Unfortunately due to where I live I had to purchase the SIM card online. For some reason FedEx required a signature on a $0.99 SIM card. By the time I finally got the SIM card and activated service on the new phone I was 2 weeks into the return period (you are only allowed 30 days). First, the reviewers that are critical about the glare on the screen. They are ABSOLUTELY correct. I didn't think it would be such a big deal for me but I can't hardly use my phone outside for anything. Both cameras are low quality. I can't get cell service to make calls or send or receive text messages. I do work in a building where it is notoriously difficult to get a reliable cell signal but ... I will be switching back to my old phone that would at least tell me if someone tried to call. With my old phone I could actually send texts as well. I tried to give the phone a fair shake and not make a rash judgement. As a result I missed the return window and I am stuck with a sub par product.",1,0,,

too many dropped calls....,"I love the features of the phone. I've had various smartphones in the past and if based on features alone, its great. Texting, apps, email, web, wifi all meet my expectations. I only gave 3 stars because it drops calls too often. Almost every conversation I have is interrupted because the call is lost. I would love to blame the provider but we have other lines with them and they don't have the same problem.",3,0,,

Not a good IPhone replacement - picture or feel..,"I was eager with the reviews that I read. It did not meet my expectation. I am coming from an IPhone and it promised so much that I was tragically crushed to find out that it was not even close to something that I could use for four things - text, talk, pictures and recording. The phone was an award hold which did not lend itself to for texting. Nor did the screen - the phone had to be tilted to be able to see the picture or screen. Which make it terrible for picture taking. Extremely disappointed. Such high hopes crushed. I am presently dealing with a Windows phone. We will see what comes about that...oh yes it was impossible or nearly impossible to put the SIM card in. I did not want to break it. The first smart phone that I had to deal with that was like that. Not so smart.",2,0,,

Gave it the old college try...,"Hello, and good day. I am currently rating this product at 3 stars, until I get my replacement unit. When I received my first model from rush direct, and was examining the phone, I noticed it refused to pick up the sim card from sim slot 1. I checked this with some other sim cards I had on hand, and ran some hardware tests via android apps. No matter what i tried, sim card reader 1 would just not work. Other than this hiccup, the phone seemed quite sturdy, everything else except the sim card 1 worked perfectly, I will update my score when i get my replacement unit, and do a full review then. Just keep in mind that Blu is a new company, so there are prone to be bugs and quality control issues as with any new startup business. I will say the experience I had with one of their other products, the BLU Dash 5.0, was very solid (if a bit too big for my uses), so hopefully the replacement unit will be as solid as that device. UPDATE: I have received the replacement unit, and unfortunately, it was just as defective as the first. I have found the radio to be defective in the replacement. Besides dropping calls left and right, it also would drain the battery extremely quickly, indicating a short of some kind in the cellular radio. I did try and pop it into the second sim card slot, and while this did solve the rapid battery drainage problem nicely, it also started to short, and began to drop calls as well. I'm guessing this particular model has a manufacturing defect in the radio or sim card reader. For those who are wondering why the battery doesn't last as long, this might have something to do with this. Overall, I can't, in good faith, recommend this product. I instead returned this, and purchased a more expensive, but still excellent for the price THL W200S, which so far has exceeded my expectations. Be warned, for the price you /could/ get a good phone, but quality control appears to be nonexistant, so buyer beware.",2,0,,
